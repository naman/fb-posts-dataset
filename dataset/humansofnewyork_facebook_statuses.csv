My father played an important role.  It was a cruel role, but it was important.  He had to clean up the favela.  The criminals weren't just going to leave.  They had to be erased.  And my father did that job.  He was a tiny man.  He dressed well.  He was educated, and polite, and humble.  To many people he wasn't a good person.  But he was a righteous person.  I didn't follow in my father's footsteps.  I became a photographer and an activist.  But I don't see my father as a bad man.  He brought rules to this place.  And today's drug traffickers enforce those same rules.   This favela is one of the safest places in the city.  Stealing is not allowed here.  You can't rape.  You can't hit a woman.  Yes, there is violence.  Because the police are always fighting the drug traffickers.  But if the drug traffickers were gone tomorrow, the favela would be a far more dangerous place.""

Favelas were built because the government didn't want to provide basic services to the descendants of slaves.  So these descendants were forced to build their own communities.  Favelas are unregulated.  They're poorly serviced.  But don't call them 'slums.'  That's a lazy translation and it's unfair to the people who live here.  The word 'slum' implies that all favelas are the same.  The word 'slum' ignores 120 years of improvement that these residents have made to their communities.  And the word 'slum' makes it easier to ignore these communities.  That's exactly what the government wants.  Because if favelas aren't viewed as real neighborhoods, then their residents don't deserve real services.  So please don't use the word 'slum.'  Because it only helps to encourage that narrative.""

Maybe you can't afford to go home.  Maybe home is too far away.  Or maybe home isn't much of a home at all.  It doesn't matter.  If you are going to be alone over the holidays-- send us an email.  We'll match you up with somebody who has an extra seat at the table.  And if you DO have a gathering planned, consider making room for one more.  We need a host for every guest.  So if you have a place to go this Christmas, please consider sharing your good fortune.  As always, matches are approved by guests and hosts before anyone is connected.  So there are no surprises.  If you are interested in participating, please email: honyfortheholidays@gmail.com

Indicate in the subject line whether you'd like to be a GUEST or HOST.  

GUESTS: Please share a little bit about yourself and why you are interested in joining HONY for the Holidays. Be sure to include your residing neighborhood, how far you are willing to travel, any dietary restrictions, and which day you are looking for holiday plans (the 24th or 25th). 

HOSTS: Please share a little bit about yourself and the gathering you will be hosting. Also be sure to include which day and time you will be hosting a gathering, how many ""seats"" you have available to guests, the type of meal you will be serving (ie meat, vegetarian), and where you are located.

We must recognize that a proven tactic for holding onto power is to deflect and channel anger onto populations with little political clout. History has proven this over and over again, to devastating results. One of our most vulnerable groups right now is the refugee population that the US has received from Iraq and Syria. Our President-elect repeatedly compared them to ""snakes"" on the campaign trail. We've learned their stories on this blog. These are innocent people who have experienced horrible trauma. They do not have a vote or a voice. So we must speak for them-- in our living rooms, our classrooms, and our courts. You may remember International Refugee Assistance Project, the nonprofit that helps organize lawyers to defend refugees. They have spent hundreds of hours helping us with Aya's case. (Wish I had good news to report there. I don't. Though we are still trying.) Yesterday I received an emotional phone call from Aya's lawyer. Her voice was shaking. She is terrified that the refugee population will be targeted in the coming months, and she asked if there was any way that we could help.

Both jobs involve a highly stigmatized diagnosis. And both involve counseling people who have had a horrible, unexpected experience.  I began working with AIDS during the 1980s.  It seemed like we were losing an entire generation of gay men.  We had no fucking idea what was happening.  It was terrifying.  The moment I shook a new client's hand, I'd steel myself for his death.  My clients never lived more than two years and I had 125 at a time.  I tried to reassure them as much as I could.  I tried to help them with their shame. But mainly I just tried to manage their terror.  Our support groups could be gruesome.  Participants would come in with IV poles and we were losing people every single week.  Group members could look around the room and see the specter of their own future.  It was horrifying.  But they came anyway. They came every week because it was better than facing it alone.  This work has always been more than professional to me.  Because after work every single night, I'd go home to my partner, and care for him.  Because he was dying too.""

So a person with PTSD is still carrying those traumatic experiences around in their body.

It's like a computer with a program that's running constantly in the background.  The idle is way too high.  And it's an exhausting way to live.  So those memories need to be revisited and processed.  And we have an amazing way of doing that.  It's called EMDR.  I won't explain it here, but it works.  It takes away symptoms.  It won't turn you into a yogi who sits on the beach.  But it will take away panic attacks.  It will take away insomnia.  And it will take away suicidal idealizations.  We aren't changing anyone.

It's the same part of the brain that kept our ancestors alive when lions jumped out of the bushes.  It's 'fight or flight.'  If a soldier's mind stays in that mode for too long, it doesn't always come back.  Everyone expects veterans to return to normal when they come back home.  The kids are so excited that Daddy's back.  Their spouse wants them to get a good job, and join the rotary, and save for a bigger house.  But it's only the veteran's body that has returned to safety.  Their nervous system is still living in a dangerous place.  PTSD creates the feeling that something terrible is always around the corner.  It can cause anxiety, confusion, and isolation from loved ones.  But worst of all, it can make it seem like things will never get better.  Most of my clients report a sense of foreshortened future.  And that's the first symptom I treat.  Because the stakes could not be higher.  Everything else can wait.  First and foremost, we're a suicide prevention program.""

PTSD is an anxiety disorder and we can treat it. But you've got to get help. In the military, you hear things like 'shake it off' or 'rub dirt on it.' And those are great messages for people at war. But you're home now. You're back with your families and the warrior mindset is no longer appropriate. If your nervous system is broken, it needs to be fixed. Just like a broken leg needs to be fixed.

A number of Marines from our battalion had killed themselves since we'd been home.  And there had been an especially bad one recently.  One of our guys had shot himself with his wife and kids downstairs.  Colonel Buhl and I realized that there'd soon be a point in time when we'd lost more Marines to suicide than to enemy action.  And I knew we had to do something.  It's an epidemic.  Every veteran knows another veteran who's taken their own life.  We have to do better.  So I approached a top psychiatrist and public health expert named Dr. Ann Beeder, and I asked her a question: Can we take all the friction out of the process of getting help?  The Headstrong Project was our answer to that question.  We wanted to create a treatment option with zero cost and zero bureaucracy, so that a veteran's only challenge was showing up.  All they have to do is overcome the stigma of PTSD.""

More Marines receive the Medal of Honor for jumping on grenades than any other action.  It's a culture where officers eat last and everyone shares their water.  These people grew up as boy scouts and girl scouts.  The whole reason they volunteered was because they wanted to do the right thing.  But the right thing is never clear in war.  If you shoot too early, an innocent person gets killed.  If you shoot too late, you lose a buddy.  So a lot of our injuries are moral ones.  Most of us come home feeling like we did something wrong.  Or we didn't give enough.  Or that our friends gave too much.  My best friend in the Marines was a guy named Ronnie Winchester.  He was the nicest guy you can imagine.  My 22nd birthday was during our officer training course.  None of us had slept.  We were all starving.  We were only getting one ration per day.  But Ronnie wanted to give me a memorable birthday.  So he put a candle in his brownie and gave it to me.  That's how nice of a guy he was.   Ronnie ended up getting killed in Iraq.   And if a guy like Ronnie got killed, you can't help but wonder why you deserve to be alive.  Ronnie was 25 years old when he died.  He is always going to be 25 years old.

So they'll plead guilty to the one charge that even remotely applies to the case.  We're representing one client who passed out on the subway.  It's a simple public intoxication charge.

When you're an immigrant, feeding your children and paying your rent comes before integrating with society.  And the support to do those things normally comes from within the community.  For Korean Americans, the community mainly revolves around the church.  Korean immigrants will go to church even if they aren't religious.  Because that's where the community is.  It's where people speak their language.  It's where they can find information, and a network, and jobs, and people to cook them meals when they're sick.  It can sometimes seem like an unwillingness to integrate.  But the closeness of the community is really about trying to survive.""

Our life had been beautiful and now everything sucked.  I didn't know what to do.  So we went to the Lego store.  He was obsessed with Legos.  That night he got so many Legos.""

I'd become accustomed to success.  But I finally found something I couldn't fix.  All my DIPG patients were dying.  It was failure beyond failure.  Kids were dying because I'm not good enough at this.  And they don't deserve it.  And neither do the parents.  It's so hard to face these parents.  They've envisioned everything that's going to happen to their child from the day they were born: the first girlfriend, the first job, the first homerun, the first time tasting meatballs, it's infinite.

The operation was a success.  This is Caitlyn a week later.  She could walk!  She could jump!  She could touch her nose!  She lived for a year after that, but then her cancer came back and killed her.  It was so hard for me.  I was so close to her family.  But right now I've had about twenty successful trials.

My office was the size of a closet and I was buying my own rats.  But I was so optimistic.  I had no idea what was facing me.   There were so many hurdles I didn't see.  Everything was new.  I never had any experts I could call or articles I could read.  I had to figure everything out on my own.  From a surgeon's viewpoint, the tumor is unforgiving.  It infiltrates the brain stem.  Everything your body feels or experiences passes through that stem.  You can't violate it with a knife.  It's futile to even think about.  So I had to figure out how to insert a catheter through the brain, and inject chemotherapy directly into the tumor.  There is zero room for error.  These chemicals must only touch the tumor.  If you miss the target by a couple millimeters, it can be fatal.  Brain surgeons aren't artists.  There isn't much room to be creative.  The innovator in neurosurgery is under a great deal of pressure.  We must invent without being too imaginative.  If we stray too far from our ancestors, it could lead to death.""

The doctors thought it was a pulled muscle at first but when they gave her the MRI, they could see stuff in her bones.  They said it wasn't leukemia, and we thought: 'Thank God.'  But then they told us it was neuroblastoma.  Stage four, high risk-- as if stage four wasn't bad enough, they had to add an extra label.  I was so scared during our first meeting that I put a statue of the Virgin Mary on the table.  I thought maybe it would protect us.  The doctors started going through the treatment plan.  They told us percentages but I didn't want to listen.  They might know about cancer but they didn't know Grace.  So I didn't want to hear it.  Two weeks after the diagnosis, a friend wrote Grace a really nice letter of encouragement.  It basically said: 'I had stage two cancer, and everything turned out just fine!'  Grace folded up the letter, and asked me: 'Mom, what stage do I have?'  And I told her: 'Four.'  And she said, 'How many stages are there?'  I wanted so bad to say: 'One hundred and fifty.'  But I had to tell her the truth.""

Millions of molecules per second pass through this machine, and we analyze all of them.  We're looking for the molecule that does not belong.  If we find it, we can target it.  And if we can target it, we can eliminate the cancer cells that depend on it.  Cancer biologists have already discovered this molecule in certain types of blood cancer.

But he'd run out of money.  So he called a town hall meeting of sorts.  He brought all the families together and told them he needed two million dollars.  And they told him: 'We'll find it.'  We refer to them now as the Band of Parents.  These people were desperate.  Many of them were broke.  And this burden was being placed on them.  It made me sick.

Small amounts of money can have outsized impact in the world of pediatric cancer.  Because these cancers are so rare, only four percent of government funding for cancer research goes to pediatrics.  Therefore research relies heavily on private donations.  Almost 30,000 people have donated so far to our fundraiser, and we've raised nearly 1.1 million to help Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center develop treatments for these cancers.

During this process, the DNA will rearrange itself hundreds of times to form all different types of cells: muscle, nerve, bone, blood, connective tissue.  If you look at these cells under a microscope, each one has special properties.  They all have codes that tell them exactly what to do and exactly when to stop doing it.  The complexity of this is extraordinary.  There are numerous fail-safes at every level to prevent mistakes.  How is it possible that it ever works correctly?

I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm sure you're feeling very sad, but don't be worried because my mom was sad too. I actually have five words for you: It's the saddest thing ever. So you can be sad whenever you want. If your child is sad, something you can do is tell them to never give up. If they are getting a needle, you'll probably feel them squeezing your hand really, really, really tight. Tell them: 'Don't worry. This is a one time thing.' The hardest part will be seeing your child with a line to a machine that gives them weird medications that might hurt and make them sad. Then you can give your child a lot of hugs because that will make them less sad. And your child will say: 'Don't worry Mom, I love you and I'm going to make it through this.' And then you can hug them even more.""

We are currently holding a fundraiser to help study and cure rare cancers like Gabe's.  So far we've raised $50,000 from 1400 donations.  That's a great start.  If even one percent of the people who follow this page were to donate, that would be 175,000 donations and the results would be staggering.  A relatively tiny amount of us could have a giant impact.  So please consider being counted!  Rare and specialized cancers like Gabe's require innovation.

Their heads blew up! I've been through a lot of things this past year. But I can tell you, if you get brain cancer, try not to worry! It will be very hard and you will get lots of fevers but you have to be brave. You have to be brave like me because I'm very brave about this thing. And if you don't know how to be brave, I can teach you. I know the surgery seems scary, but I have four words for you: you'll be on anesthetics.

You'll meet the amazing doctors, nurses, and researchers who have committed their lives to this fight.  You'll meet the moms and dads who refuse to crumble while living out their greatest fear.

102099916530784_1239883486085749,"Susie passed away yesterday evening.  She came into my life quite unexpectedly five years ago.  I was photographing in Brooklyn one evening when I saw the coolest little dog sitting on a stoop.  I sat down to pet her, and after a few minutes, her owner told me that he was unable to care for her anymore.  He asked if I could take her.  I was broke at the time.  I was sleeping on a friend's couch.  And everyone that I asked told me that it was 'not the right time' for a dog.  But I was so charmed by Susie, and the whole encounter seemed so fated, that I offered to take her.

It was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Susie was twelve years old at the time and didn't need much.  I'd never had a dog before.  It was a new experience.  I was introduced for the first time to a dog's unexplainable and unconditional love.  After a few weeks, it seemed that Susie's only concern in life was staying as close to me as possible.  There was now a joyous reunion waiting for me at the end of every workday.  And I learned that there are few greater blessings than a wildly happy dog greeting you at the door. 

Over the last few years, my fiancé Erin developed her own relationship with Susie.  As many of you know, Erin started a nonprofit called Susie's Senior Dogs, which seeks to place older dogs in loving homes.  Older dogs have the hardest time getting adopted.  Because there is such a demand for young dogs, so many senior dogs are either euthanized or forced to spend the remainder of their lives in a shelter.  Over the past few years, Susie's Senior Dogs has placed several hundred senior dogs into homes.  There is a warm and active community of people who follow the page.  In fact, I think that half the people who come to my book signings are more excited to meet Erin than me.  

So it's been a tough few days, but Erin and I are both very thankful that Susie came into our lives.  She was such a special friend.  She was my introduction to the love of dogs.  And she helped Erin discover her purpose in life.  So in a way she's going to stick around forever.  I encourage everyone to follow Susie's Senior Dogs, and consider allowing an older dog to change your life as well.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/a.102107073196735.4429.102099916530784/1239883486085749/?type=3,2016-04-23 09:52:24,497905,16465,29137,374217,65189,111,53,58293,37

But now that three months have passed, I feel that all of you who followed Aya's story deserve an update.  We filed her appeal in early January.  A very encouraging development occurred almost immediately when The Department of Homeland Security agreed to remove Aya's missing father from the case.  Aya's lawyers were quite happy with this because they believed it simplified matters quite a bit.  They are now only appealing on behalf of Aya, her ill mother, and her three young siblings.  For obvious reasons, Aya's lawyers are confident that it should be very difficult to classify any of them as security threats.

The frustrating part of the process is that it is completely obscure.  No feedback, updates, or timelines are given.  All of Aya's 'in-the-know' advocates have told me that they'd have expected a decision by now in her case.  So we continue to wait.  Adding to the frustration, we are unable to consider other resettlement options while the US sits on her case.   Until there is movement, Aya is essentially frozen in a very insecure limbo.  Considering the circumstances, she is doing OK.  She's very stressed right now because her mother is ill, and the responsibility for her family's security lies entirely on her shoulders.  We are supporting her the best we can from 5,000 miles away.  We're trying to make her situation as comfortable as possible using the money that we raised in December, supplemented by a generous and quiet donation from the GoFundMe company.

We'd just moved to Long Island, and the two of us were sitting in a car outside our new house, and my husband was standing on the porch, and she pointed at him, and said: 'You know he molests me.'  I felt so guilty.  For five years I'd let it happen.  He fucking knew how much I loved her.  She was the whole reason I got sober.  I've been trying to compensate my whole life.  I could never discipline her after that.  Now she has substance abuse problems so I'm raising my granddaughter myself.  I'm still trying to compensate.

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I've refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn't want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: 'Maybe the timing is not right.'  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I've come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I've watched you retweet racist images.  I've watched you retweet racist lies.  I've watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I've watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to 'pay the legal fees' of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I've watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists' families.   I've watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I've watched you compare refugees to 'snakes,' and claim that 'Islam hates us.'  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I've also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm— the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a 'unifier.'  You are not 'presidential.'  You are not a 'victim' of the very anger that you've joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.  

Sincerely,
Brandon Stanton",,status,,2016-03-14 10:44:35,2373248,73072,1150907,2149884,207527,12308,733,1163,1629

In addition to the people who follow this page, so many of you choose to routinely engage and participate in the community.  You've created such a unique and supportive culture in the comment section. And you've donated nearly $5 million to our fundraisers in 2015. I think the HONY community is largely composed of people who try to choose compassion over cynicism, and that's why we've been able to accomplish so much this year.  In short—this is a group of people who 'shows up.'  So thanks so much for showing up last year. Here are some of the things we were able to accomplish:

In January we raised $1.4 million to provide summer programs, college trips, and scholarships to students at Mott Hall Bridges Academy. The money is being administered with the assistance of The Fund for Public Schools. Earlier this year, the students took their first class trip to Harvard. This summer, they participated in a new summer enrichment program featuring such courses as horticulture, financial literacy, and social justice. Vidal, who inspired the effort, is beginning a new chapter as a high school freshman. And Ms. Lopez (The Lopez Effect) has continued to be recognized for her dedication to students, recently giving a TED Talk and becoming a finalist for The Global Teacher Prize. 

In August we raised $2.3 million to help Syeda Ghulam Fatima in her quest to end bonded labor in Pakistan. Fatima has been extremely careful and deliberate in her acceptance of the funds, consulting with many other stakeholders and advocacy groups about how best to maximize the impact. She recently received the final installment, and plans to break ground on a new Freedom Center in 2016 to shelter and rehabilitate freed workers. Since our fundraiser, 105 slaves have been freed with the assistance of Fatima's Bonded Labour Liberation Front, including one of the slaves featured on HONY. Earlier this year, the Clinton Global Initiative chose Fatima for its Global Citizen Award. 

Most recently we raised $750,000 to assist thirteen Syrian refugee families selected for American resettlement. We are partnering with the nonprofit Together Rising (www.togetherrising.org), who will be helping us receive the funds and get 100% of the donations to the families-- in a smart way that doesn't conflict with other aid they may be receiving. 

Finally, and closest to my heart, we are supporting Aya through her appeal process for American resettlement. Our petition ended at almost exactly one million signatures. (I'm choosing to view this as a favorable omen.) Now comes the less glamorous but critical process of filing the appeal itself. Aya's lawyers at the International Refugee Assistance Project have been working over the holiday to get the appeal finished as soon as possible, and plan to be done next week. I'll share all major developments on the blog, but as we move forward, I will be providing more detailed updates on the petition page here: http://chn.ge/1OxgK7F

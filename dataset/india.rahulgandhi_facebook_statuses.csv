गाँधी जी के सीने में जो गोलियाँ लगी थी वो इसलिए लगी थी क्योंकि वो हिंदुस्तान को जोड़ रहे थे
गाँधीजी की जो विचारधारा है वह नयी नहीं है।हमारे धर्म में-गीता में,उपनिषदों में लिखा है कि हिंदू होने का मतलब सच्चाई की रक्षा करना है
हर किताब में लिखा है कि हर एक व्यक्ति का आदर करो,अन्याय के खिलाफ लड़ो, सत्य बोलो और सत्य की रक्षा करो- गाँधीजी ने इस विचारधारा को आगे बढ़ाया
गाँधीजी समझते थे कि हमारा तिरंगा एक कपड़े का टुकड़ा नहीं है- इसके पीछे रिश्ते हैं, इस तिरंगे के पीछे भाईचारा है, प्यार है
चाहे किसी के पास भी सत्ता हो,अगर वो देश में नफरत फैलाने की कोशिश करेंगे,डराने की कोशिश करेंगे,तो ये देश उस बात को मानने के लिए तैयार नहीं है

Invitees and Friends,

I would like to welcome all of you here.

Two nights ago I was sitting in my home, preparing my notes for this address and I wished very much that instead of speaking to you, I could have shown you Nehru's  India. I wish I could have taken you to his birth place of Allahabad and the wheat fields that feed this great country. 
 
I wish I could have taken you to Naini jail, where Nehru was imprisoned

along with so many brave Indians during our freedom movement and where he learnt some of his life's greatest lessons. I wished I could have taken you at least to Teen Murti House, his home in Delhi, and shown you how simply Nehru lived, how much of himself he gave back to his people. But this is unfortunately a two day conference. You will have to promise me to  come back so we can make those  journeys together another time. But today, on our last day, I would like to read to you what I read few days ago and show you a little something of Nehru. This comes from his will & last testament.

I  have been  attached to  the  Ganga and the  Jamuna rivers in Allahabad ever since my childhood and, as I have grown older, this attachment has also grown. The Ganga, especially, is the river of India, beloved of her people. She has been a symbol of India's culture and civilization, ever-changing, ever-flowing and ever the same Ganga. She reminds me of the snow-covered peaks and the deep valleys of the Himalayas, which I have loved so much, and of the rich and vast plains below, where my life and work have been cast. Though I have discarded much of past tradition and custom,  and  am  anxious that  India  should  rid  herself of  all shackles that bind and constrain her and divide her people, and suppress   vast  numbers   of   them,   and   prevent   the   free development of the body and the spirit; though I seek all this, yet I do not wish to cut myself off from that past completely. 

I am proud of that great inheritance that has been, and is, ours, and I am conscious that I too, like all of us, am a link in that unbroken chain which goes back in the dawn of history in the immemorial
past of India. 

It was this desire to be one with his beloved country that lead Nehru to ask that his ashes be scattered over the Ganga and India's soil.

We welcome you to Nehru's India. Nehru himself is an ancient idea, as old as the great rivers and fields of this country he loved so much. He is an ancient idea, yes, but he is also a part of living India. His ideas and his politics are present very much today, even though there are those who wish to rub him out, to erase him and his legacy from the country he so dearly treasured and helped build.

Nehru  understood  there  was no  separation between him  and  India. There was no distance between him and its land, from nature. Indira Gandhi once wrote that her father was furious when in May 1953 he was told that Mount Everest was conquered.  Mount Everest can be climbed, he replied, but can never be conquered. Nehru saw no distinction between India's people  and  himself. Nehru  merged with India, and India with him.

Nehru's idea of India is a country where a billion people choose their destiny  and  live  in  harmony  together.  India  is  a  country  where democratic  principles  are  cherished  deeply.  Nehru   developed  and protected those democratic ideals and that is why this is a nation where one sixth of humanity lives in peace.

I thank you for joining us today because it is especially important that we preserve this India of Nehru's – an India that is secular and tolerant. Today this legacy, that has denied no man or woman their voice, and that we have preserved for close to 70 years, is more important than ever.

Nehru resonated with his countrymen because he was an expression of their way of thinking. Nehru was a man of ideas, but never an ideologue.

He was a beacon to millions of Indians and indeed to the world because he represented freedom. Nehru's fight was for all of mankind. And that is why Nehru's imprint is felt not just in India but across the world.

Many people in Nehru's generation fought against imperialism. Imperialism at that  time was the  suffocating norm.  It  was what the powerful, rich world believed was their right over countries like ours.

To fight against imperialism in those days, when the weight of the world was stacked against you, meant one had to believe deeply in freedom.

It took Nehru a lifetime of struggle to understand and absorb an idea that he loved, to see it from the heart.

Most people think freedom is just the ability to act. You can do what you want, I do what I want. But freedom cannot be truly understood without an intimate experience of what the absence of liberty feels like.

When Nehru was freed from Naini jail, he was asked by his captors to sign their visitors book. And what Nehru wrote was this: he thanked the British for imprisoning him because it was in jail that he was freed of his anger. Nehru left jail a free man.

You can be in jail for years, and in shackles, and then be released into the world after your sentence has been served and still walk away in chains. Carrying anger transports your prison walls everywhere with you. As the poet Samih ul Qasim once wrote in his famous poem 'End of a talk with a jailor':

From the narrow window of my small cell, I see trees that are smiling at me And rooftops crowded with my family

And windows weeping and praying for me. From the narrow window of my small cell— I can see your big cell!

Nehru spent 3262 days in prison.  And he understood that it is not the simple removal of the chains that makes you free, it's how you react to the world after it has been cruel to you.
 
Nehru walked away from jail a free man, and even Winston Churchill who had long opposed him said that Nehru was a man who conquered hate and fear.

But back to the present. Today, what I find troubling is how we can condemn people because the ideas they treasure are not our own. Nehru understood deeply that everyone is entitled to their viewpoints. Nehru gave space for his opposition, even when they were practically non- existent. At the time when the Opposition was sparse in Parliament, he reached out to them, gave them a feeling that while electorally they may be weak, in his world they were valued partners in nation-building. He recognised that  every perspective  is  unique,  even  those  he  fought vehemently. He  defended the  rights of  those  he did not  agree with and never imagined silencing them.

When Nehru  was at the  peak of  his power, when he was loved by everyone in India, someone wrote a letter to one of the big newspapers and the letter was anonymous and it was signed Chanakya. The letter said that Nehru is loved in India, everybody believes in Nehru and this is going to go to Nehru's head. Nehru was a democrat, but with all these praise and all these admiration Nehru  is going to become a dictator. And, a few months later the real author of the letter was revealed and the author was Jawaharlal Nehru himself. 
 
It was Nehru's ability to question – to stop, ask, and understand what was going on  – rather than  his desire to  speak that  was one of his biggest strengths.

True democratisation is not  simply the right to  vote. It  is about the devolution of power. It is about handing power to the weakest in the room.  India could well have gone in a different direction but that it became  a  liberal democracy committed  to  the  rule  of  law, to  the independence of the judiciary and the independence of my friends here, press, was in overwhelming measure due to India's first Prime Minister. Here in India, as Manishankar Aiyar ji said, three million local elected representatives run our villages and towns. This makes me really proud that out of three millions, half of these are women. It was the planning and vision of Nehru and his compatriots and colleague's that gave one out of 6 people on earth the right to choose their destiny. This is why India proudly stands where it does today.

Europe took half a century, two world wars, millions of dead people, destroyed cities, smashed families to build a democratic structure. India with three times the number of the people built a democratic foundation through a non-violent movement. No world wars. No violence.

What Nehru's generation built for India is what he deeply wished to see in the world around his country. 
 
Nehru's leadership was one of inclusion and compassion, not force, not violence. Nehru did not believe that legitimacy could ever come from violence. Legitimacy can only come  from  compassion, conversation, from listening to and understanding the opposing view. As Nehru said, ""Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of soul. Peace is not merely the absence of war. It is also a state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to peaceful people.""

We have a tendency to worship great men. When we do that we cast them in stone. We freeze them in time. There is no doubt that Nehru was a great man. But more than a man Nehru was a dynamic way of thinking, constantly evolving, forever compassionate.

So let us not diminish Nehru but let us learn from him. Let us learn to stand up for what we believe is correct, no matter the cost. Let us cast aside the  dead weight of  hatred  and  intolerance. Let us learn from Nehru's  example and  give ideas the  freedom  to  flow, let  us  never suppress an idea simply because it did not originate from us.

""Nehru defended the rights of those he didn't agree with and never ever silenced his critics. It was Nehru's ability to understand and listen rather than to speak. Democracy is an act of faith, it is not a simple process that takes place every 5 years. Nehru's vision was of compassion, conversation; not coercion or use violence.
It was the vision and planning of Nehru that give one out of six people on earth the right to chose their destiny"".

October 13, 1949 Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal #Nehru addressed a House Reception. As part of a multi-week goodwill tour of the United States, Nehru first met with President Harry S. Truman and then with Congress. India proclaimed itself neutral in the developing Cold War and America officials sought to remain on close terms with the nation which had just emerged from British colonial rule. The Prime Minister spoke to the crowded room for 15 minutes. Discussing the similarities between the United States and India, he stated, ""I have come here, therefore, on a voyage of discovery of the mind and heart of America and to place before you our own heart. Thus we may promote that understanding and cooperation which, I feel sure, both our countries earnestly desire."" Following the two addresses, the Prime Minister enjoyed a lunch reception in the Capitol with the House and Senate Foreign Affairs committees. Among the attendees was Representative Frances Bolton of Ohio, who joined the Prime Minister on a tour of President George Washington's Mount Vernon home the day before. Prior to World War II, the standard manner in which both the House and the Senate received addresses by foreign leaders was to invite dignitaries to a one-chamber reception.

Panjab University is not a central university, due to which the fees are high. Will you intervene so that students are benefited?

The previous UPA government made efforts to give more funds to the university. I'm sure that it also worked for PU's central status. We are not in the government now. You should take up the issue with those in power (NDA).

How can youth from a modest background and without any political background go up the ladder in politics?

I have tried to democratise the Congress and its various wings. Young people, irrespective of caste or background, are reaching top posts. The National Students' Union of India (NSUI) is a wonderful platform and gives an opportunity to go up the ladder in politics.

Why did your government not open a Sanskrit university in 10 years of rule?

It will be a narrow viewpoint if we compartmentalised education in languages. I don't agree with you that for you need a dedicated university for the promotion of Sanskrit. Students should be taught all languages, say Hindi, Japanese or English, in all institutions.

How can you deal with the drug issue in Punjab? Why doesn't the Congress launch a movement to save youths from drugs?

I was slammed in 2012 for my statement on the issue when I said that seven youths out of 10 in Punjab are into drugs. But the menace has reached an alarming stage. If it remains so, the state would collapse. The NSUI should launch a campaign against it. I am ready to join the campaign. You can also take the help of Partap Singh Bajwa (Punjab Congress president, sitting beside him).

When will you get married?

I will see (smiles).

You talked about bringing in more youths in the party, but when it came to tickets, they were given to the kith and kin of big political families. I am a Congress sympathiser, but it is difficult to approach you as you are always surrounded by security men. I have written over 1,000 emails to you. But got a reply to only one, and that too about birthday wishes.

It is impossible for me to reply to every email as I get 2,000-3,000 a day. Instead, you should have given your suggestions to those leaders who are around you. What do you want to do for the country? Tell me! I will give you the ticket and field you in the elections (Later, Rahul asked his aides to note down her address and email).",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10152765379879921/?type=3,2014-10-17 08:16:52,1053,102,83,1053,0,0,0,0,0

The Congress party's vision for India's economic progress has always seen the business community and the poor as crucial partners in achieving that vision from the freedom struggle onwards. However, the Opposition leader's predilection to favour one or two business houses is nothing but crony capitalism and must be challenged. Such practices not only result in crores being lost but also signal to the rest of the world that India is not a level playing field. This is detrimental to the interest of creating a sound business environment in our country. Forward thinking, progressive business interests are firmly behind us. In this election, you see an icon of corporate India, Nandan Nilekani, fighting for the Congress' vision in Bangalore.

Q. Many people say that these elections aren't ordinary elections.
They will have a long term impact on the politics of the country. Do
you agree with this assessment?

RG: Every election is important as every one of them reflects India's
choice. This election is a clash between two ideologies. On one hand,
we believe that we must include every person in India's progress.
People belonging to every religion must stand together and live with
love and brotherhood. On the other hand our opponents divide people,
they play the politics of anger and hatred.

It is generally predicted that we will lose. This was the case in 2004
and in 2009. A few days back a friend of mine showed me an opinion
poll which predicted that the NDA will win 270 seats. When I told him
that I have seen such opinion polls, he pointed out the date of the
opinion poll was 2004. So in 2004, opinion polls predicted 270 seats
for the NDA. In 2009, opinion polls predicted 270 seats for the NDA.
2014, the  opinion poll is saying the same. I feel that let the
numbers stack up and we'll see.

Q. The difference between 2004 and 2014 is that there is 10 years of
anti-incumbency. You have been campaigning across India. It is being
said that this is the toughest election that the Congress has ever
faced. Do you feel there is some dissatisfaction with the UPA among
the people? Do you feel people want a change?

RG: See, 10 years is not a short period of time. There is some
anti-incumbency. I don't even say that the UPA has made mistakes. It
has made a few mistakes. But the UPA has also done a lot of good work.
We have brought 15 crore people above the poverty line. We have given
people rights that couldn't even have been imagined earlier. We have
given the Right to Food, to the entire India, the Right to Employment
to the entire India and the Right to Education to the entire India.
How have we been able to achieve this? Because there has been rapid
economic growth. If you compare the growth during our period and that
of the BJP you would see that the growth during the UPA has been much
faster.The reason behind this is that we have worked with peace and
harmony, not hatred. We have worked together and taken everyone along.
Their politics is the politics of a select few. They talk of India
Shining, they believe that they should ensure the prosperity of a few,
while the others watch helplessly. Our politics is based on taking
everybody along. We work towards ensuring peace and harmony and this
paves the way for progress. The strength of our people drives this
progress.

Q. You repeatedly stress that your government has taken a number of
legislative steps to curb corruption. You speak of the RTI and Lokpal.
But it is believed that if there is anger against the UPA, it is on
the issue of corruption. Do you think the government should have been
more proactive against corruption and communicated among the people
more effectively that your government has taken steps to tackle
corruption and price rise?

RG: We aren't as good at marketing as the NDA. I opened the BJP
manifesto to see what they have to say about corruption. I found one
line: ""we will fight corruption through e-governance"". If you are
serious about fighting corruption, two things need to be done. First,
give power to the people of India by decentralisation. The decisions
which should be taken by you, by the citizens of India, are being
taken by the chief minister or by the District Magistrate. We have to
empower the people much more. This has to be done politically and
through Panchayati Raj.  Second, corruption cannot be fought without
an institutional framework.

Our opponents keep saying that they are against corruption. But what
is their proposal? We brought the RTI. What was happening behind
closed doors has now come into the open. For instance, earlier if a
road was being built and half the funds were being siphoned off, no
one came to know. We gave India the RTI and now any question can be
asked. If corruption has come into the open, it is because of this. If
you want to eradicate something, you must first recognise it. So
through the RTI, we have brought corruption out in front of the
people. We have brought it out so that it can be eliminated. If you
don't recognise it, how will you fight it? We have given weapons to
fight corruption. We brought the Lokpal. Five Bills are pending before
Parliament. We were trying to get these Bills passed, but the
Opposition blocked them. BJP leaders said these are Rahul Gandhi's
Bills. These aren't Rahul Gandhi's Bills, they belong to the people of
India. If they really want to fight corruption, they must work towards
this institutional framework.

We have done a lot to fight corruption. Wherever we found instances of
corruption, we took action against it. Now, let's look at the other
side. In Gujarat, there is no action on RTIs, Lokayukta Bill is on
hold. The court instructed the Gujarat government to bring a Lokayukta
but nothing was done. He (Shri Narendra Modi) says I am the
chowkidaar. We don't want one chowkidaar. We want the citizens to keep
a watch against corruption. The battle against corruption is a long
and deep one, it is a battle that needs to be fought continuously.

Regarding price rise, there has been a worldwide increase in fuel
prices. We have tried to counter it. We have delisted fruits and
vegetables in our states so that farmers can sell them directly. But
if you want to counter inflation and have an impact on rising prices,
the main issue that one needs to address is wastage of what the famers
sell. If you go to UP or Bihar, you are from Bihar, you would see that
if potatoes are being produced, it gets wasted.  If you want to curb
inflation, you have to build infrastructure, you have to build cold
chains. You have to link the farmer to food processing units. How will
this be done? Through FDI, through food parks. This is what want to
do. Who is blocking this? They are because of their vote base.

Q. You have mentioned these things in your manifesto but you have
yourself admitted that there were a few shortcomings during the UPA.
You didn't become a part of the government even though the Prime
Minister wanted you to be. You have now said that you are willing to
be part of the government if the UPA MPs want. If there is a UPA-3,
how do we believe that it will be different from UPA-2

RG: UPA-2 created a platform and brought 15 crore out of poverty.
These were people who were outside the production process. They were
caught in the cycle of poverty. They used to come in and out of
poverty depending on the circumstances. We created a platform for
them, we provided a protective floor beneath them. We gave the Right
to Food, Right to Employment and Right to Education. What was the
impact? Wherever school enrolment was 60 per cent, it is now 90 per
cent. Those who used to go to bed hungry are now assured of food. So a
platform was built. Now what do we build on top of this platform? Five
years back we spoke of manufacturing corridors. If you wear a watch,
it is made in China. Shoes are made in China, suits are made in China,
even microphones are made in China. Our people spend their money, they
(China) are the ones who make profits. Why don't we manufacture here?
For that we need infrastructure. We have started the largest
infrastructure project: a manufacturing corridor. How have we been
able to do this? Because there has been robust growth for the past ten
years. Wealth was generated. There was no such wealth during the NDA.
There is no way you could have initiated such an infrastructure
project. From Delhi to Mumbai, Mumbai to Chennai, from Amritsar to
Kolkata and Bengaluru to Chennai, a dedicated railway line, power and
water supply.  This is a collaboration with Japan. They know best
about manufacturing. There will be thousands of industries in this,
crores of our youth will get jobs and one day you will have Made In
India written on your watch. This is one step in our vision. Secondly,
we will give strength to our poor: free medicines and the Right to
Health. If you are poor and you go to a hospital, you will be given
good treatment. If you need a surgery, the hospital will conduct it.
The second thing we want to provide our poor is a right to homestead.
Many people in villages as well as cities don't have a roof over the
heads. We want to guarantee that they will have a roof over them.

The third thing is most important to me. 50 per cent of our population
are women. I think we are not utilising their strength enough. Women
are being kept behind, they are hidden, we have to bring them forward.
Our plan is 33 per cent reservation, women police stations and the
manner in which we have linked them to banks through SHGs. They have
opened small business, you would have seen in Bihar. Similarly we want
to link crores of women to banks, provide them an identity.

So these are the three main things we would like to do. There are a
few more things that supplement these but these are the main steps.

Q. If you look at the Congress campaign, you speak of removing
poverty, you speak of secularism, of democratic institutions, all this
is fine. But today's youth are very impatient. In addition to a long
term vision, they also want solutions to short term problems. If he
wants to study, he wants the best education. If he completes his
education, he wants a job instantly. This is what is important to him.
But your policies and programmes seem to be very long term. So somehow
it seems that Congress is still playing Test cricket even when the
world has moved to Twenty20. Congress must also learn to play Twenty20
in politics.

RG: We do play Twenty20. We have taken many Twenty20 steps. The 70,000
crore loan waiver was a Twenty20 step, not a Test match step. Our
endeavour is to provide the youth a place. Whatever I done in the
Youth Congress or the NSUI is towards this. You asked me why I didn't
join the government, it was because I was trying to bring more and
more youth into the Congress party and the Youth Congress. I was
creating such a structure.

18 years was made the age for voting, the Congress party did this. It
is the Congress which speaks of employment and manufacturing. Look at
what they (BJP) do. Speaking of Twenty20 matches, 45000 acre land was
given to an industrialist in a true Twenty20 manner, within 2 minutes.
What was the rate? Rs 1 per metre. Rs 1 per metre, 45000 acre,
Twenty20. We don't play this kind of Twenty20. Our Twenty20 is to take
the youth forward, our Twenty20 is to seriously fight corruption,  our
Twenty20 is to provide a vision.

Q. If we talk about these elections, they have become centred around
one individual: Narendra Modi. BJP has tactically and strategically
projected him. And it their strategy appears to be working. His
rallies are attracting crowds, people want to listen to him, Narendra
Modi is pursuing an aggressive kind of politics. Don't you think the
Congress was late in realising the challenge he posed?

RG: This election belongs to 120 crore people. This can never belong
to any one person. This is not about any one person, it is not about
Rahul Gandhi, it is not about Narendra Modiji. This election is about
the future of 120 crore people. Our approach is that we must empower
these 120 crore people. Their approach is concentrating power with one
person.  We believe that we can progress by decentralising power, by
bringing people into the system. They think given one person complete
power, give them a key and the car will start running. They people of
India know better. They live their daily lives, they understand
precisely what kind of change we need to bring in India. I admit that
they (BJP) are good at marketing. We are the ones who work.

Q. You have said time and again that your battle with Narendra Modi is
an ideological one. But if we look at the entire election campaign, it
seems to have been reduced to accusations and counter-accusations.  He
calls you a Shezada, makes personal allegations about your family.
There are personal attacks on him from your party as well. So where is
the ideological battle?

RG: I don't make personal attacks. I don't say anything bad about any
one. They think differently. They make personal attacks, they say
negative things about me and about others as well. This is their
ideology, their approach. These are their values, my values are
different. I have been taught to respect everyone, even one's enemies,
and speak with love and decency. This is what I always try. Sometimes
people in our party end up saying certain things. But if you look at
our senior leadership be it Dr Manmohan Singh, or the Congress
president, Antony ji or Chidambaram ji, they speak with a lot of
respect and courtesy.

Q. I will ask you a few personal questions. We keep getting news, you
have also been asked many times, on Priyankaji's political role.

RG: She is my sister. Whatever she decides to do, I will support her
fully. But in the end, the decision will have to be hers. It is her
life, you will have to ask her. I am her elder brother and I will
support her in  whatever she does.

Q. You have said that if your party is close to forming a government
and if your MPs want, you will take up the responsibility. But still
many fear that you might also sacrifice the position the way Soniaji
did in 2004, that history would be repeated.

RG: I have said 2-3 times that I will become the Prime Minsiter if the
Members of Parliament want me to. You may remember that Sonia ji never
said that she wanted to be the Prime Minister. This was her stand
since 1998. If the MPs want, I will take up the responsibility. Cent
per cent. Not 99 per cent, 103 per cent. The government we will form,
it will be a government that will transform India. It will not be a
conventional kind of government. It will be a radical government and
it will bring about radical structural changes. It will do phenomenal
work. It will be a government that will change systems and structures.

Q: You say that if Rahul Gandhi's government is formed

RG: It will not be Rahul Gandhi's government, it will be a government
of the people of India.  Their voice will echo in the corridors of
power. And it will echo in every room of every government. We will
give as much power to the Indian citizen as we can. We will take power
from out hands and place it in the hands of the Indian citizen saying
""you are a citizen of India, work for the country, we have faith in
you"". This will be our approach.

Q. How can we interview and not ask when you are getting married? Even
though you have already said that you will marry when you find the
right girl.

RG: (laughs) This is still my ansywer, I will marry when I find the right girl.

Q. When will you find the right girl?

RG: I am a caught up in work. Let's see.

Q. One last question. Is Rahul Gandhi afraid of the election results
in any way. If not, can we say that Rahul Gandhi will be in politics
for the long race?

RG: This is not a race for me. The biggest problem in India is that
the government and the systems do not empower the Aam Aadmi. The power
is concentrated in the hands of the Chief Minister and Prime Minister.
I want this concentration to be broken. Power should be in the hands
of villages and small towns. The Chief Minister must have powers,
there is no denying that. But every person must have the decision
making capacity.  We should run the government by including everyone.
This is my life's mission. We might win or lose elections but my
mission will remain the same. Actually, I feel angry that the
potential our country has, the power that our country has is not being
utilised to the fullest. The system does not support a small
entrepreneur or a farmer. I want to change this. I know this cannot
happen in five years, it will take a lot of time. But I will work
towards it.

Q: Thank you for giving us your time in the middle of elections.

RG: Thank you for your time.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10152349698609921/?type=3,2014-04-23 04:29:23,1123,165,142,1123,0,0,0,0,0

""They (BJP leaders) go to Karnataka and give big speeches there. They bring Yeddyurappa, who was the Karnataka Chief Minister and remained in jail, to stage and then say they are against corruption...,"" Mr. Gandhi said while canvassing for party state unit president and candidate from Sirsa Lok Sabha seat Ashok Tanwar.
""...then they go to Chhatisgarh where mining mafia rules and say we are against corruption, but they cannot see their own Chief Minister and ministers there. Then they go to Madhya Pradesh and say we are against corruption, then cannot see their corruption. Then they go to Gujarat where three cabinet ministers spent jail term, but they cannot see corruption there... Rest of the places they see corruption,"" he said.
Mr. Gandhi said unlike the BJP his party took action against corrupt politicians. ""Wherever we see corruption, we take action,"" he said.
The Congress vice president then targeted BJP for trying to divide the people on religious lines.

He alleged that BJP's ""divisive"" policy was responsible for spoiling the country's secular fabric, while stressing that Congress's ideology was to unite the people irrespective of caste, creed and religion.

Mr. Gandhi said wherever they (BJP leaders) go, they breed hatred among people of different religions.

""Yeh aapko aapas mein ladate hain, Hindu ko Muslim se ladayange (They make you fight each other, pit Hindus against Muslims),"" he said, and referred to the attack of BJP ally Shiv Sena activists in Mumbai on migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

""We take everybody along, be it Sikhs, Hindu or Christians or Muslims... This is our politics. We do not play politics of hatred or politics of division, we play politics of love because we know nation grows when everybody is taken along,"" he said.

Taking a dig at the hype over 'Gujarat model', Mr. Gandhi said it is just a ""gas-filled balloon"" which will burst after the Lok Sabha elections.

He said the BJP had floated 'Shining India' balloon in the 2004 elections which it lost and after it lost in the 2009 elections too, the party's managers wanted to come up with something new.

""They have come with a new balloon. Earlier they used to fill it with air, this time they have filled it with gas. Name of the balloon this time is 'Gujarat model',"" Mr. Gandhi said.

In the elections, Dalits, youths, labourers and weaker sections of the society will go and press the button, and the balloon which has been raised through marketing will burst.

Then the BJP leaders will rue how they had spent so much only to hear loud burst of the balloon, he said.

He also took up issue of Sikh farmers in Kutch region and criticised the Gujarat government led by Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate.

""They were crying, they told me they had been working for the last several years, but the Gujarat government threw them out and told them they are outsiders... In Karnataka, they beat women. For us nobody is an outsider, all are insiders for us,"" he said.

Dismissing Mr. Modi's 'Gujarat model', Mr. Gandhi said each state should have its own model.

""Haryana has set an example how a state is run and it does not need any Gujarat model. Haryana needs only Haryana model. Every state has its own model... Congress party respects every state. We respect Haryana because we know you can run your state. Here you do not need Gujarat model. Let Gujarat model be run in Gujarat,"" he said, adding Haryana was ahead on many fronts including wheat and milk production, besides making the country proud in the field of sports.

He also slams the opposition for failing to come out with an election manifesto so far. The Congress had spoken to about 5 lakh people in its bid to find out what the country wanted and then drafted its manifesto.

""But the BJP while indulging in big talks had not come out with its manifesto even when the polling of the first phase was only a day away,"" Gandhi said.

Rahul Gandhi while addressing a rally at Dharmashala, Himachal Pradesh.
Watch the complete speech here
http://goo.gl/JVpBHl
Highlights from the speech
I spoke to ex-servicemen for nearly an hour. They told me about their problems. I thank the ex-servicemen who gave their life and blood for the nation. 
The ex-servicemen told me they have been asking for one rank, one pension for the last 25 years. Today, they thanked me for accepting their demand. I told the ex-servicemen that they need not thank me, rather I should thank them because they gave their lives for the nation. 
This decision will benefit 23 lakh ex-servicemen. Rahul Gandhi only raised your issue, it was the PM and Soniaji who implemented it.  I thank both of them too.

Himachal Pradesh has huge potential for tourism. Congress government provided infrastructure to Himachal. 
We tried to provide drinking water supply in Dharmashala. The Opposition says, the Congress only works for the poor, and it is the BJP who builds roads. I asked the surface transport ministry to show me statistics. Statistics show, we build 3 times more roads in five years than the NDA govt did in 5 years.

In India, there are two ways of working. One is the way of Gandhiji, the way of love. The other way is of anger and hatred, to pit one community against the other. The Opposition must understand this if it wants to work for the nation.
When we gave statehood to Himachal Pradesh in 1972, these Opposition leaders opposed it saying, Statehood Ko Maro Thuk.   

When Rajiv Gandhiji spoke of computers and cellphones, the topmost BJP leaders, I dont want to name them, stood in Parliament and said, computerization will render lakhs of youths unemployed and it will harm the nation's economy. 

The computer revolution took place. Then their own IT minister Pramod Mahajan claimed that it was the BJP which gave computers and cellphones to India.
 Sardar Patelji spoke about RSS as a poisonous organisation which can destroy India. Now those leaders who spent their lives in RSS are now going to erect a statue of Patelji. Probably they have not read Sardar Patelji's writings, or the history of India.  

If they open the Gita, whatever they say is opposed to the teachings of Gita, which calls for love and compassion. These leaders have nothing to do with history. They only give speeches, whereas the truth is that India has a thousand year hold history of brotherhood.
The Congress government lifted 15 crore people above poverty line, condoned Rs 70,000 crore debts of farmers. Our government gave you the rights for tribals, right to information. 

Even the Opposition leaders admit the UPA government has worked for the poor. Now, those who are above poverty level and below middle class - nearly 70 crores - we will bring them to the middle class. 
We will change the higher education system, and provide more and more people, to your children, university education. Jobs will come from manufacturing. 

We are creating special industrial freight corridors to connect the big metros, and this will give jobs to crores of people. The watches that you are wearing from China, will now be made in India.
I want to speak to the women. You demanded 12 LPG cylinders a year. I put this before the PM. It took two minutes for him to accept. The truth is that only 12 LPG cylinders wont do. I want to see 50 pc women in ministers, assemblies and Parliament. 

I want more and more women in power. Opposition leaders stalled the Women's Reservation Bill in Parliament. I asked some of the opposition leaders why they are stalling it. They said, if women get reservation, their seats will get reserved. 

These leaders are keeping you out. And I promise you, Congress party will give you reservation in Parliament, in Congress party.  Similarly, we will give reservation to youths in Congress.

The biggest step towards eradicating corruption was the Right to Information, which we gave you. We gave you the Lokpal Bill also. 

These are the rights that we have given you. Today any man can write to the RTI to find out what Rahul Gandhi told the PM. 

We want to give you more power, through Panchayati Raj. BJP leaders six strong bills against corruption in Parliament. We brought the Land Acquisition Bill to give you the right price for your land. These Opposition leaders stalled this bill too at every step. 

In 2004, they spoke of India Shining, but voters pressed the button for Hand symbol.  In 2009 too, we won because we condoned farmers' debts, gave the Right to Work. 

That's why they are stalling Parliament. Congress is a party of weaker sections, of women, of minorities, of tribals, and of youths. We work for all sections.

We are going to win the elections with your love and affection.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10152276736794921/?type=3,2014-03-20 07:04:20,1460,137,138,1460,0,0,0,0,0

For achieving this vision, the Policy identifies five well-defined objectives and 11 priority areas and suggests policy interventions in each priority area. The priority areas are education, skill development and employment, entrepreneurship, health and healthy lifestyle, sports, promotion of social values, community engagement, participation in politics and governance, youth engagement, inclusion and social justice. 

The focused approach on youth development and empowerment involving all stakeholders, as envisaged in NYP-2014, would result in development of an educated and healthy young population, who are not only economically productive, but are also socially responsible citizens contributing to the task of nation-building. 

It will cover the entire country catering the needs of all youth in the age-group of 15-29 years, which constitutes 27.5 per cent of the population according to Census-2011, that is about 33 crore persons.It will replace NYP-2003, to take care of developments since 2003 and future policy imperatives.

The President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, addressed the Nation on the eve of the 65th Republic Day. Following is the text of the President's address on the occasion:

My Fellow Citizens,
On the eve of 65th Republic Day, I extend warm greetings to all of you in India and abroad. I convey my special greetings to members of our Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces and Internal Security Forces.
The Republic Day commands the respect of every Indian. On this day, sixty four years ago, in a remarkable display of idealism and courage, we the people of India gave to ourselves a sovereign democratic republic to secure all its citizens justice, liberty and equality. We undertook to promote among all citizens fraternity, the dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation. These ideals became the lodestar of the modern Indian State. Democracy became our most precious guide towards peace and regeneration from the swamp of poverty created by centuries of colonial rule. From within the spacious provisions of our Constitution, India has grown into a beautiful, vibrant, and sometimes noisy democracy. For us, the democracy is not a gift, but the fundamental right of every citizen; for those in power democracy is a sacred trust. Those who violate this trust commit sacrilege against the nation.
Some cynics may scoff at our commitment to democracy but our democracy has never been betrayed by the people; its fault-lines, where they exist, are the handiwork of those who have made power a gateway to greed. We do feel angry, and rightly so, when we see democratic institutions being weakened by complacency and incompetence. If we hear sometimes an anthem of despair from the street, it is because people feel that a sacred trust is being violated.
Fellow Citizens,
Corruption is a cancer that erodes democracy, and weakens the foundations of our state. If Indians are enraged, it is because they are witnessing corruption and waste of national resources. If governments do not remove these flaws, voters will remove governments.
Equally dangerous is the rise of hypocrisy in public life. Elections do not give any person the licence to flirt with illusions. Those who seek the trust of voters must promise only what is possible. Government is not a charity shop. Populist anarchy cannot be a substitute for governance. False promises lead to disillusionment, which gives birth to rage, and that rage has one legitimate target: those in power.
This rage will abate only when governments deliver what they were elected to deliver: social and economic progress, not at a snail's pace, but with the speed of a racehorse. The aspirational young Indian will not forgive a betrayal of her future. Those in office must eliminate the trust deficit between them and the people. Those in politics should understand that every election comes with a warning sign: perform, or perish.
I am not a cynic because I know that democracy has this marvellous ability to self-correct. It is the physician that heals itself, and 2014 must become a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the last few years.
My Fellow Citizens,
The last decade witnessed the emergence of India as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The slowdown of our economy in the last two years can be some cause for concern but none for despair. The green shoots of revival are already visible. The agricultural growth in the first half of this year has touched 3.6 per cent and rural economy is buoyant.
2014 is a precipice moment in our history. We must re-discover that sense of national purpose and patriotism, which lifts the nation above and across the abyss; and back on to the road of prosperity. Give the young jobs and they will raise the villages and cities to 21st century standards. Give them a chance and you will marvel at the India they can create.
This chance will not come if India does not get a stable government. This year, we will witness the 16th General Election to our Lok Sabha. A fractured government, hostage to whimsical opportunists, is always an unhappy eventuality. In 2014, it could be catastrophic. Each one of us is a voter; each one of us has a deep responsibility; we cannot let India down. It is time for introspection and action.
India is not just a geography: it is also a history of ideas, philosophy, intellect, industrial genius, craft, innovation, and experience. The promise of India has sometimes been mislaid by misfortune; at other times by our own complacence and weakness. Destiny has given us another opportunity to recover what we have lost; we will have no one to blame but ourselves if we falter.
Fellow Citizens,
A democratic nation is always involved in argument with itself. This is welcome, for we solve problems through discussion and consent, not force. But healthy differences of opinion must not lead to an unhealthy strife within our polity. Passions are rising over whether we should have smaller states to extend equitable development to all parts of a state. A debate is legitimate but it should conform to democratic norms. The politics of divide and rule has extracted a heavy price on our subcontinent. If we do not work together, nothing ever will work.
India must find its own solutions to its problems. We must be open to all knowledge; to do otherwise would be to condemn our nation to the misery of a stagnant mire. But we should not indulge in the easy option of mindless imitation, for that can lead us to a garden of weeds. India has the intellectual prowess, the human resource and financial capital to shape a glorious future. We possess a dynamic civil society with an innovative mindset. Our people, whether in villages or cities, share a vibrant, unique consciousness and culture. Our finest assets are human.
Fellow Citizens,
Education has been an inseparable part of the Indian experience. I am not talking only of the ancient institutions of excellence like Takshashila or Nalanda, but of an age as recent as the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, our higher educational infrastructure consists of over 650 universities and 33,000 colleges. The quality of education has to be the focus of our attention now. We can be world leaders in education, if only we discover the will and leadership to take us to that pinnacle. Education is no longer just the privilege of the elite, but a universal right. It is the seed of a nation's destiny. We must usher in an education revolution that becomes a launching pad for the national resurgence.
I am being neither immodest, nor beating a false drum, when I claim that India can become an example to the world. Because, the human mind flourishes best when it is, as the great sage Rabindranath Tagore said, free from fear; when it has the liberty to roam into spheres unknown; in search of wisdom; and when the people have the fundamental right to propose as well as oppose.
My Fellow Citizens,
There will be a new government before I speak to you again on the eve of our Independence Day. Who wins the coming election is less important than the fact that whosoever wins must have an undiluted commitment to stability, honesty, and the development of India. Our problems will not disappear overnight. We live in a turbulent part of the world where factors of instability have grown in the recent past. Communal forces and terrorists will still seek to destabilize the harmony of our people and the integrity of our state but they will never win. Our security and armed forces, backed by the steel of popular support, have proved that they can crush an enemy within; with as much felicity as they guard our frontiers. Mavericks who question the integrity of our armed services are irresponsible and should find no place in public life.
India's true strength lies in her Republic; in the courage of her commitment, the sagacity of her Constitution, and the patriotism of her people. 1950 saw the birth of our Republic. I am sure that 2014 will be the year of resurgence.

सवाल : क्या प्रधानमंत्री पद की जिम्मेदारी लेंगे?

जवाब : हम एक लोकतांत्रिक संगठन हैं। हमें लोकतंत्र में विश्वास है। भारत की जनता अपने चुने हुये प्रतिनिधियों के द्वारा ये तय करेगी कि इस देश का प्रधानमंत्री कौन होगा। देश के हित में कांग्रेस का सत्ता में आना जरूरी है। और उसके लिए संगठन ने जो जिम्मेदारी दी है या जो भविष्य में देगी, उसे मैं पूरी निष्ठा के साथ निर्वाह करूंगा।

सवाल : माना जा रहा है कि कांग्रेस से अब मैदानी संघर्ष नहीं हो रहा है। सांसद-विधायक मैदान में नहीं जाते?

जवाब : नहीं, ऐसा नहीं है। यह बहुत बड़ा जनरलाइजेशन है। कांग्रेस में बहुत योग्य लोग हैं। जमीन से जुड़े लोग हैं। सांसद-विधायक फील्ड में नहीं जाते, इस बात से भी मैं सहमत नहीं हूं। पार्टी से युवाओं को जोडऩे की जरूरत है। हमने पिछले सालों में इसमें काम किया है। और आगे भी करेंगे।

सवाल : आप कह रहे हैं कि आम आदमी पार्टी से सीखेगी कांग्रेस?

जवाब : कांग्रेस पार्टी एक मजबूत और गतिशील संगठन है। कांग्रेस ने पहले भी देश की राजनीति के स्वरूप को बदला है और आगे भी बदलेगी। जबसे मैं राजनीति में आया हूं तबसे हम यह सब बातें उठाते रहे हैं। इसमें से कुछ चीजें आम आदमी पार्टी ने अमल की हैं। पर हमारा और उनका रवैया अलग-अलग है। मैं उनके कई तरीकों से सहमत नहीं हूं। हमारे निर्णय लोगों के हित में शार्ट टर्म गेन के बजाए उनके सुरक्षित भविष्य को देखकर होने चाहिए।

सवाल : भाजपा के कांग्रेसमुक्त भारत और नरेंद्र मोदी की लोकप्रियता पर आप क्या कहेंगे?

जवाब : आज भाजपा एक व्यक्ति आधारित सत्ता चाहती है, जो देशहित में नहीं है। सत्ता किसी एक व्यक्ति की सोच और उसके अपने तरीकों से नहीं चलनी चाहिए। सबको साथ लेकर चलने से ही 120 करोड़ लोगों के भविष्य को संवारा जा सकता है। कांग्रेस इस देश के डीएनए में है। भाजपा कांग्रेस मुक्त भारत की बात कह रही है। वह यह नहीं समझती कि कांग्रेस ही एक ऐसी राजनीतिक शक्ति है जिसने लोगों को देश में जोड़कर रखा है।

सवाल : प्रियंका की अगले चुनाव में क्या भूमिका होगी? क्या वे चुनाव लड़ेंगी?

जवाब : प्रियंका मेरी बहन और मेरी दोस्त है। साथ ही, कांग्रेस की सक्रिय कार्यकर्ता हैं। और इसके नाते वे मुझे और संगठन को मजबूत करने के लिए मदद कर रही हैं। मुझे नहीं लगता कि उनकी कोई चुनावी भूमिका होगी।

सवाल : क्या आपको सौ प्रतिशत भरोसा है कि कांग्रेस-यूपीए इस बार भी आम चुनाव में जीतेगी?

- मुझे लगता है कि पिछले दस वर्षो में हमने काफी अच्छे काम किए है। जिसमें हमने विकास के ढांचे को बदला है। जिसमें मनरेगा और राइट टू एजुकेशन, भूमि अधिग्रहण और लैंडमार्क निर्णय लिए गए हैं। कांग्रेस अधिकार देती जा रही है। आप देखेंगे हमने राइट टू इंफार्मेशन दिया। राइट टू फॉरेस्ट दिया। राइट टू आइडेंटिटी-आधार-दिया। राइट टू फूड दिया। यूपीए सरकार, लोगों को राइट्स देने वाली सरकार के रूप में इतिहास में दर्ज होगी।

जैसा कि मैंने आपसे कहा था कि आमतौर पर कांग्रेस को कम आंका जाता है। जैसा कि 2004 और 2009 में भी कम आंका गया था, लेकिन ऐसा नहीं हुआ। हां, अब होने वाले आम चुनाव बहुत एक्साइटिंग है और मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि हम चुनाव में अच्छा करेंगे।

शिक्षा, स्वास्थ्य, रोजग़ार के साथ ही ग्रोथ रेट को भी बढ़ाना जरूरी है। हम इस बारे में अपने घोषणा-पत्र में विस्तार से बताएंगे।

आपने यह नहीं पूछा है, लेकिन मैं यह खासतौर पर बताना चाहता हूं कि भारत की एक बड़ी ताकत है इसका एजुकेशन सिस्टम, लेकिन इसे खोलना होगा। यह सिस्टम ऐसा नहीं लगता, जो सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों की जरूरतों को पूरा कर सके। दस सालों में कांग्रेस ने सबसे बड़ी कोशिश यही की कि ज्यादा से ज्यादा बच्चों को स्कूल भेजा जा सके, उन्हें शिक्षा मिल सके। और इसके बाद सबसे बड़ा अगला कदम हमारा यह होगा कि कैसे हम शिक्षकों को ताकत दें, उन्हें मजबूत बनाएं। लोगों को रोज़गार मिल सके, हमने मेन्युफैक्चरिंग के लिए एक बड़ा ढांचा तैयार कर लिया है। बिजली के क्षेत्र को खोल दिया है। हाईवे बनाए गए है। कॉरिडोर खड़े कर दिए है। दिल्ली-मुंबई  कॉरिडोर और बेंगलुरू-चेन्नई जैसे कॉरिडोर बना रहे हैं। हम देश को इस तरह से बदलना चाहते हैं कि सभी वर्गों के लोगों को फायदा मिले।

भास्कर : कहा जा रहा है आप तत्पर नहीं रहते जिम्मेदारी लेने के लिए। रिलक्टेंट हैं?

राहुल गांधी : हमारी पार्टी में यह फैसला वरिष्ठ नेता लेते हैं। पहले भी इसी तरह से फैसले लिए जाते रहे हैं।

लेकिन प्रश्न यह नहीं है कि फैसला कौन लेता है। यह तो कांग्रेस अपने तरीके से ले लेगी। मेरा प्रश्न आपसे जिम्मेदारी से दूर रहने का है। जैसे कि सत्ता ज़हर है... जो बात बहुत फेमस है। क्या आप जिम्मेदारी नहीं लेना चाहते?
 

-'सत्ता ज़हर है'  का मतलब यह नहीं है कि मैं जिम्मेदारी लेने को तत्पर नहीं हूं। देखिए मेरी जिंदगी में रिलक्टेंस नाम का कोई शब्द नहीं हैं। 'सत्ता ज़हर है' यह ऑब्जरवेशन है, कि पावर जब आती है तो उसके साथ जो खतरे आते हैं उससे कैसे निबटना है, यह वह है। 'सत्ता जहर है' का अर्थ है कि पावर का इस्तेमाल जनता की भलाई के लिए करो। खुद को बड़ा करने के लिए, खुद को ताकतवर बनाने के लिए इसका इस्तेमाल मत करो।

लेकिन मेरा प्रश्न सीधा है। क्या आप किसी भी ऐसी जिम्मेदारी को स्वीकार करेंगे? या आप रिलक्टेंटली हां कहेंगे। विचार करूंगा, यह कहेंगे। क्या कहेंगे?
-देखिए, मेरे परिवार के किसी भी सदस्य ने पावर के लिए कभी काम नहीं किया। मेरे पिता, मेरी दादी किसी ने भी नहीं।
 

जी नहीं, मैं पावर की बात नहीं कर रहा हूं?
-देखिए, मैं कांग्रेस का सिपाही हूं। जो भी मुझे आदेश मिलेगा मैं उसका पालन करूंगा। कांग्रेस जो कहेगी मैं वही करूंगा। मेरा सवाल यह है कि हमारा सारा आर्ग्यूमेंट एक पोस्ट को लेकर क्यों रुक जाता है? राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर यह बहस क्यों होती है?  एक व्यक्ति विशेष और पद विशेष की बात ही क्यों चलती है? राजनीति में सुधार की बात क्यों नहीं चलती? कोई भी सिस्टम को बदलने की बात करने को तैयार नहीं है। बात यह होनी चाहिए कि हम पॉलिटिकल सिस्टम को कैसे बदलें।

लोग अब स्पेसिफिक डिक्लेरेशन चाहते हैं - सीधी घोषणा। तो कांग्रेस स्पेसिफिक क्यों नहीं है?

- कांग्रेस इस बारे में कभी भी स्पेसिफिक नहीं रही। मुझे कांग्रेस ने जो काम करने को कहा, मैंने उसे पूरा किया। जो भी काम देंगे, उसे पूरा करूंगा।

हां, जहां तक पावर की बात है तो मैं महात्मा गांधी के शब्दों की याद दिलाना चाहता हूं। उन्होंने कहा था कि जब आप सत्ता की बात करें तो आखिरी आदमी के बारे में सोचें। यही खतरा है कि सत्ता आते ही हम आखिरी आदमी को भूल जाते हैं।
कांग्रेस इतनी छोटी क्यों होती जा रही है? क्या आप इसके प्रदर्शन से संतुष्ट हैं?

- मैंने कभी दावा नहीं किया कि कांग्रेस में सब कुछ ठीक है, कुछ चीजें ऐसी हैं जिन्हें ठीक करना है। मैंने ये सभी बातें पार्टी के सामने रखी हैं।

आम जनता से कैसे पूछेंगे कि किसको उम्मीदवार बनाया जाए?

-कांग्रेस लोकतंत्र को गहराई से लागू करना चाहती है। हम आम जनता को पार्टी में, संगठन में शामिल कर रहे हैं। आज आपने देखा कि हमने पार्टी के घोषणा-पत्र को जनता के सामने खोल दिया है। देश भर से आए युवाओं के बीच में पहली बार ऐसा प्रोसेस हुआ। मैं चाहता हूं कि आम आदमी भी कह सके कि भैया, मैं आपके घोषणा-पत्र में यह चाहता हूं।

क्या वजह है कि सहयोगी पार्टियां भी कांग्रेस से दूर होती जा रही हैं?

-सहयोगी हमसे दूर जा रहे हैं, यह सही नहीं है। हमारे डिस्कशन अभी चल रहे हैं। जम्मू-कश्मीर में हमारे सहयोगी हैं, महाराष्ट्र में हमारे सहयोगी हैं। बिहार में हमारे सहयोगी नहीं थे, इस बार बात चल रही है।

बिहार में लालू यादव से गठबंधन करते हैं तो भ्रष्टाचार के विरुद्ध आपका मुद्दा तो पूरी तरह ध्वस्त हो जाएगा। कांग्रेस ऐसा क्यों करेगी?

- अभी तो बातचीत चल रही है। पार्टी की अलायंस कमेटी ये फैसले लेती हैं और उनकी सिफारिशें मुझे मंजूर होंगी।

अपने निजी शौक पर बोले राहुल

- मुझे स्विमिंग और रनिंग पसंद है। मैं मेडिटेशन और ऐकिडो जापानी मार्शल आर्ट की प्रैक्टिस करता हूं। मानसिक फिटनेस के लिए शारीरिक फिटनेस बहुत जरूरी है। मुझे टेक्नोलॉजी में भी बहुत दिलचस्पी है। मेरे पापा राजीव गांधी जी पायलेट थे और मेरे पास भी पायलेट लाइसेन्स है।

""You don't have to run just the self-help groups, you have to run the state as well. This is true empowerment""
Watch the complete speech: http://youtu.be/d7CMvWjkyvE
Excerpts from his speech: 
- ""We have three main priorities in Jammu and Kashmir: empowering women, providing employment and implementing Panchayati Raj.""
- ""We want Ummeed to take Jammu and Kashmir forward. We want to see the power of the people, the mothers, the sisters of Jammu and Kashmir, not of bureaucrats and the government.""
- ""A day should come when your voices are so strong that the government will have no choice but to listen.""

Congress vice-president Shri Rahul Gandhi believes that Women's Self Help Groups have the potential of unleashing a silent revolution across rural India. Seeking to tap this revolutionary potential, Shri Gandhi addressed a public meeting of Women's SHG members mobilised under the UPA government's flagship scheme Ummeed, at Budgam in Jammu and Kashmir. 

Shri Gandhi began by recollecting his experience of working with women SHGs in Uttar Pradesh. ""Our work with SHGs in UP began 8 years ago in UP. Initially we had 2-3 groups. The government told us that the scheme will not work in UP. Still we went ahead and continued with our work. Today, 11 lakh women have been organised into SHGs, that too without the government's help,"" Shri Gandhi said, evoking a loud applause from the SHG members, who were impressed at the success story in UP.  

Recounting an interaction he had with a woman in UP, Shri Gandhi said ""I asked a woman, 'what is poverty?'. She said that whenever someone came home, I used to say there is no one there. Poverty is a lack of self confidence."" 

According to the Congress vice-president, empowerment of women is a pre-requisite for development.  ""Every state that has progressed, it is because the women there have progressed,"" he said. 

Shri Gandhi expressed hope that the Ummeed programme would transform Jammu and Kashmir. ""We want Ummeed to take Jammu and Kashmir forward. We want to see the power of the people, the mothers, the sisters of Jammu and Kashmir, not of bureaucrats and the government. not bureaucrats or govt. We want to strengthen your voices so much that govt is compelled to listen to you,"" he said. 

""We have three priorities in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. ""The first is empowering women, providing them access to finance. J&K Bank is there but banks like State Bank of India and other big banks must come here. This will benefit the women here and provide them easy access to funds. Their empowerment and self-confidence is important,"" he said. The second priority according to Shri Gandhi is employment. Referring to the Himayat scheme, Shri Gandhi said ""the state and central governments have worked towards providing vocational training so that the youth from here get jobs not just here but in Bangalore, Mumbai etc."" 

""Our third priority is Panchayati Raj through which we can bring government to villages. Elsewhere 50 per cent seats in the Panchayat are reserved for women. We want that just as the way you step out of home, the way you speak without reading from a piece of paper, you must contest Panchayat elections,"" he said. This statement immediately struck a chord with the women present as they had cited ""stepping out of home"" and ""speaking in public without reading from a piece of paper"" as proof of their empowernment. But Shri Gandhi went even farther and said, ""not just Panchayat elections, we want you to contest Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections as well. Not just those who sit in the front but even those who are right at the back"". 

""You don't have to run just the self-help groups, you have to run the state as well. This is true empowerment,"" he added. 

Shri Gandhi told the women that their work didn't end with the SHG. ""I tell the women of UP that your work must not end once you get a lone. Now that you have control of your lives, your job is to empower other women,"" he said. 

An SHG member had earlier referred to Shri Gandhi as well as Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Shri Omar Abdullah as her brothers and asked of them as a Rakhi gift that they visit her village in Lar, Ganderbal. Recalling the girl's request and responding to it, Shri Gandhi said ""I will go anywhere you invite me. Thank you"".  Shri Gandhi mingled with the crowd and interacted with the SHG members after his speech. 

Earlier in the day, Shri Gandhi inaugurated a cold-storage facility and addressed a public rally at Lassipora in Pulwama district of south Kashmir. ""Kashmir is famous for apples. We want the apples from here reach places across the world. You need better technology and other infrastructure for that. You also need better connectivity with banks,"" he said in Pulwama. He also said that the Congress-led UPA Government at the centre has been giving priority to ensure jobs for the youth in Kashmir and other states.   The Congress leader added that the educated youth must get proper skill development training too. ""We have already taken several initiatives in this direction"" said Rahul Gandhi and added ""We also initiated several projects for women empowerment also and also sent funds for Jammu and Kashmir. Lots of women are getting its benefits too"".  

He also stressed the stability of the coalition with the National Conference and expressed his support for Shri Abdullah.

Asiyah, a member of a women's self help group in Kashmir, will not forget this day for some time to come. She had a detailed interaction with Shri Rahul Gandhi when he ventured into the crowd to interact with the SHG members after his speech in Budgam. The bold and outspoken manner in which Asiyah spoke to Shri Gandhi bears testimony to the empowerment that is taking place through the Ummeed scheme. She told the Congress vice-president about the various problems the people, women SHG workers face in Kashmir,. She narrated the drawbacks in the implementations of various schemes on the ground. Shri Gandhi listened to her patiently and provided solutions to some of her concerns. As soon as Shri Gandhi left after the interaction, a beaming Asiyah was received a hero-like response from her friends and fellow-SHG members. A beaming Asiyah provided a recap of her interaction with Shri Gandhi to them as well as media persons who had gathered around her. Asiyah's delight showed how empowering it is just to know that one's voice is being heard.

To change J&K, the local leaders need to be empowered, youth need to be given employment and the women have to be helped. 
Our focus since 2004 has been on giving rights to people of this country
We passed the food bill. We didn't want anyone to be hungry in this country
Look at our programs, MNREGA or Food bill, the truth is that without Panchayati Raj and Sarpanches, these programs can't function
These programs develop from villages
Sarpanches and Panchayats will have to support the government
Some critical decisions will be taken in small villages, and we can't do it without your cooperation
If the situation needs to change in J&K, we need to give power and responsibilities to our Sarpanches and local bodies
The women in J&K are our backbone, we need to help them. I can't see many women here today
We are providing training to thousands of youth in this country
What you can do, no MLA or minister can do. The local work needs to be done by you - that is your role. 
We will implement 73rd, 74th Amendment here. You will get your dues, I will fight for you 
I have just spoken to the Chief Minister about Food Security and he was concerned that a little less food will be allocated under the new law. 
We want the law implemented and we will make up the deficit
Whatever we're doing in the rest of the states, we want to do that in J&K
Look at Kerala where the Sarpanchs are empowered, that is the political future and that is what will happen in J&K

Highlights from the speech: Welcome you all, especially those who are standing on the terraces.
Today in politics we have two kinds of thinking - one of the Congress and the other of the opposition
We say that India needs infrastructure. So does the Opposition. 
We also raise the question of who benefits from the infrastructure - the person using the roads should have enough to eat.
We say the poorest in India should have the biggest dream.
The daily wage earner should look at an aeroplane and dream that his son pilots it someday
To the women who have gathered here, I want you to have the world's biggest dreams for your children, otherwise I have no interest in politics. If we don't let you dream, India can't progress.
When you want to take someone's land away that comes easily, but when people have to be fed, they ask where the money will come from After Food Security Bill, our new slogan: pet bhar ke roti kayenge, Congress party ko layenge.
Before the Land Acquisition Bill, anywhere in India, the government could have acquired the lands of the poor.
The farmers suffered, toiled over their land and one day someone took it away from them.
We brought in the Land Acquisition Bill to let the farmers' sons dream big, to respect your blood and sweat.
Disease is the greatest reason of poverty. In Rajasthan, a daily wage earner gets free medicines.
This will be implemented across the country.
The Opposition said about the MNREGA, Food Security Bill, Land Acquisition Bill - that it can't be done. They lost the elections and then tried to stall Parliament.
But they will not be able to stop us - we will continue to work for you.
I inaugurated a power plant today and told them - the common man doesn't understand MegaWatts. I was told that Rajasthan today generates thrice the electricity it did 10 years ago.
Whatever we have said, we've delivered - that is the difference between us and them (the Opposition).
This is the country of young people and in this country most of the young people are  poor. They have big dreams.
Until someone does not give them right to food, to job their dreams will not be fulfilled. We will fulfill your dreams.
The government has to function not only in Delhi and Jaipur but at the local level.

AMETHI: Citing the example of Punjab where peace was restored after a long period of militancy, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said there was a ""lot of anger"" in India which should be brought down and the country should move forward by taking all sections along. 

""India is a thought...youths make it, you make it. We have to include everyone and move forward,"" the Congress leader said as he praised paramilitary force CPRF's efforts to restore peace in restive areas of the country. 

He spoke of how a Khalistan supporter, also an MLA, joined political mainstream in Punjab after peace was restored in the once militancy-wrecked state. 

Addressing a function on the occasion of foundation laying ceremony of CRPF training centre at Trishundi, the Congress vice-president said that due to peace in the presence of CRPF and ""Congress, Akali giving him a place in the political system"", the Khalistan supporter's anger came down and he joined political mainstream. 

""There is a lot of anger in the country. It has to be brought down"" as was done in Punjab, Gandhi said. 

The Congress leader said that CRPF played an important role in bringing normalcy in Punjab. 

He regretted that only 30-40% CRPF personnel get housing facility and added that jawans say that they were not afraid of fighting for the country, but of the hardships to their families.

So we value your thoughts, concepts and ideas."" said Rahul Gandhi amidst loud applauds.

So, it is high time you use your valuable vote to remove the organisation standing between you and the government.""

So you remove the Left Front as you have done in Kerala and West Bengal. The Left Front works for itself and the CPM, not for the people,"" he said.

""All contracts in government schemes in Tripura go to CPM cadres or officials; all jobs are given to CPM party men. If you are not in the ranks of the CPM, you are not going to get any benefit from state government. It was like the days in erstwhile communist-ruled Soviet Russia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia where the people ultimately threw communist rulers to oblivion. Even communists in China told me that it was time for communists in India  to understand the market. The ideology of communists in India has become obsolete and people are bound to suffer if they are in power,"" said Rahul Gandhi.

He promised utilization of central assistance provided to Tripura in cent per cent for the benefit of the people. ""I will ensure that the voice of the people of Tripura reaches New Delhi. Not only Tripura, but the voice of every State in the country should reach Delhi so that the Centre can take adequate steps to resolve the problems of the States,"" stressed the Congress leader.

24967709920_133090136856283,"Rahul's speech| On Hope and Power
This morning I got up at night, 4 O'clock in the morning I got out into the balcony I thought ""Now you have a big responsibility in front of you and this people are standing behind you, people are standing on your side."" It was dark and it was cold and I had decided I am not going to tell you only what you wanted to hear, I decided I goanna tell you little bit about what I feel, I want tell you about hope, and also want to tell you about power.
When I was a little boy I loved to play badminton. I loved it because it gives me balance in a complicated world. I was taught how to play in my grandmother's house by two police men who protected my grandmother. They were my friends, then one day they killed my grandmother and took way the balance in my life. I felt pain that I never felt before and many of us have experienced this so you will understand what I am saying.
My father was in Bengal and he came back the hospital was dark green and dirty. And there was a huge crowd screaming outside they were very angry and as we entered they were screaming and shouting. It was the first time in my life that I saw my father was crying, he was the bravest person I knew and yet I saw him crying.
I was small but I could see my father was broken, he had taken away his mother and he was broken. In those days our country wasn't what it is today. In the eyes of the world we had nothing. We were worthless. We didn't have money, we didn't have cars, everybody said were a poor country. Nobody thought about us. Same evening I was my father addressing the nation on television. I knew like me he was broken inside and even like me he was terrified of what lay in front of him but when he spoke that night I felt the small glimmer of hope. It was like a small ray of light in a dark sky. I can still remember what it felt like. If you think back lot of you will also remember this. The next day I realized that many people had seen it. Today as I look back and I has a political career of 8 years in 42 years I can see it was a small ray of hope in the darkness that helped changed India into what I is today. Without hope you can not achieve anything. You can have plans, you can have ideas, but unless you have hope you can not change anything. I want to talk to you about power.
Last night every single one of you congratulated me, many of you came and hugged me and congratulated me. Everybody congratulated me but last night my mother came to my room and she cried, why did she cried? she cried because she understand that the power so many people seek its actually a poison she can see it , what it does to a people around and to the people they love but the most important that she can see it, she not attached to it, the only anti poked to this poison is for all of us to see it for what it is really is and not become attached to it, we should not chased power for attribute to some power, we should only use it to empower voices. In our work it is my mother experience for the life time it is my experience for 8 years and am sure many of you to deal with power every day, understand what I am saying and realize the positive and the negative, and we must not forget that there is negative, that you have to be very careful when you doing administer power, when you use power, today India is not like what it was in 1984.
We are no longer seen as worthless.
Today the entire world is courting us.. Today we are the future.. and as I said before nations are not build on scheme and plans. They are raised on a foundation of hope. I am standing here because I believe that Congress party is the symbol of this hope and has the potential to embody it. I like to end again by saying that for me the Congress party is now my life. The people of India my life and I will fight for the people of India and for this party. I will fight with everything I have and I invite all of you to stand up and take on this fight.
Thank you

एक ही आंख से एक ही तरीके से देखूंगा... चाहे वो यूथ कांग्रस का हो चाहे वो बुजुर्ग हो, चाहे unexperience हो, experienced हो, महिला हो जो भी हो जो आप कहेंगे मै से सुनूंगा और समझने की कोशिश करूंगा राजहनीति में मैं 8 9 साल से हूं और मैं एक बात समझा हूं काम करना है सोच समझ कर करना है गहराई से करना है और जल्दी से नही करना है बदलाव हो तो लम्बे तौर पर हो ऐर गहराई से हो एक दो चीजें मैं आप से कहना चाहता हूं.. बदलाव की बात आपने कही.. नीयम और कानून की बात मैं कहना चाहता हूं.. कांग्रस पार्टी एक ऐसा संगठन है दुनियां का सबसे बड़ा राजनीतिक संगठन है मगर इसमें नियम और कानून नही चलते हैं... शायद एक भी नियम और कानून इस पार्टी में नहीं है हम हर दो मिनट नये नियम बनाते हैं पुराने नियम दबा देते हैं और यहां शायद किसी को भी नहीं मालूम कांग्रस पार्टी के नियम किया है। मज़ेदार संगठन है कभी कभी पूछता हूं मैं अपना आप से कि भैया ये चलता कैसे है ये election कैसे जीतता है.. ये बाकी पार्टीयों का खत्म कैसे कर देता है... समझ नही आती है बात मगर election के बाद धड़ाक से कांग्रेस पार्टी जीत गई.. वर्कर खड़ा हो गया नेता खड़े हो गए... शीला जी मुझे कह रही थी कि भैया पता नही क्या होता है कि election के पहले सब खड़े हो जाते हैं और धड़ाके से लड़ जाते हैं.........
इसमें हिन्दुस्तान का DNA भरा है। और जो हमारे विपक्षी दल हैं वो समझतें नहीं हैं इस बात को। वो देखतें हैं और कहतें हैं कि ये हो क्या रहा है। कोई कहता है कि हम किसी एक जात की पार्टी है.. कोई कहता की मैं किसी एक धर्म की पार्टी हूं.. और कांग्रेस पार्टी कहती है कि हमारी DNA तो हिन्दुस्तान की है। हम न जात पहचानतें हैं..न धर्म पहचानतें हैं.. हम सिर्फ हिन्दुस्तान की DNA पहचानतें हैं.. सबके सब है।
तो नीयम और कानून की जरुरत है.. पहली बात.. दूसरी बात.. हम leadership development पर focus नहीं करते। आज से 5-6 साल बात ऐसी बात होनी चाहिए कि अगर किसी state में हमें chief minister की जरुरत हो.. तो जैसे पहले photo हुआ करती थी.. 40 फोटो हुआ करती थी कांग्रेस पार्टी की... नहरु जी.. पटेल.. आजाद.. giants हुआ करते थे.. उनमे से कोई भी देश का प्रधान मंत्री बन सकता था.. ये बात हमने करनी है.. हमें 40-50 नेता तैयार करने हैं.. जो देश को चला सकें.. सिर्फ प्रदेश को नहीं.. देश को चला सकें.. 40-50 नेता ऐसे तैयार करने हैं हर प्रदेश में.. हमारे पास 5-6-7-10 ऐसे नेता हों जो chief minister बन सकें। और हर district में ये बात हो.. हर block में यह बात हो.. और अगर हमसे कोई पूछे की कांग्रेस पार्टी क्या करती है.. कांग्रेस पार्टी हिन्दुस्तान के भविष्य के लिए नेता तैयार करती है.. कांग्रेस पार्टी सेक्यूलर नेता, ऐसे नेता जो गहराई से हिन्दुस्तान को समझते हैं, जो जनता से जुड़े हुए हैं वैसे नेता तैयार करती है। ऐसे नेता तैयार करती है, जिनको हिन्दुस्तान के सब लोग देख कर कहते हैं भईया हम इनके पीछे खड़ा होना चाहते हैं। तो लीडरशिप डेवलपमेंट की जरुरत है और इसके लिये ढांचे की जरुरत है सिस्टम की जरुरत है इंफार्मेशन की जरुरत है क्योंकि यहां पे जो नहीं होता है, इसलिये नहीं होता है कि कोई चाहता नहीं है, इसलिये नहीं होता है कि कोई सिस्टम नहीं है और सिस्टम बनाया जा सकता है और इस सिस्टम को आप लोग बनाओगे और आप लोग चलाओगे। हम टिकट की बात करते हैं, जमीन पे हमारा कार्यकर्ता काम करता है यहां हमारे डिस्ट्रिक्ट प्रेसिडेंट बैठे हैं, ब्लॉक प्रेसिडेंट्स हैं ब्लॉक कमेटीज हैं डिस्ट्रिक्ट कमेटीज हैं उनसे पूछा नहीं जाता, हैं यहां डिस्ट्रिक्ट प्रेसिडेंट? हैं। टिकट के समय उनसे नहीं पूछा जाता, संगठन से नहीं पूछा जाता, ऊपर से डिसीजन लिया जाता है भईया इसको टिकट मिलना चाहिए, होता क्या है दूसरे दलों के लोग आ जाते हैं चुनाव के पहले आ जाते हैं, नहीं सुनो, सुनो। आ जाते हैं, चुनाव हार जाते हैं और फिर चले जाते हैं और हमारा कार्यकर्ता कहता है भईया, वो ऊपर देखता है चुनाव से पहले ऊपर देखता है, ऊपर से पैराशूट गिरता है धड़ाक! नेता आता है, दूसरी पार्टी से आता है चुनाव लड़ता है फिर हवाई जहाज में उड़ के चला जाता है।
सबसे पहले कांग्रेस पार्टी के कार्यकर्ता की इज्जत होनी चाहिए और सिर्फ कार्यकर्ता की इज्जत नहीं, नेताओं की इज्जत, नेताओं की इज्जत का मतलब क्या है? कि अगर नेता ने अच्छा काम किया है, अगर नेता जनता के लिये काम कर रहा है चाहे वह जूनियर नेता हो या सीनियर नेता हो, जितना भी छोटा हो, जितना भी बड़ा हो अगर वो काम कर रहा है तो उसे आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए, अगर वो काम नहीं कर रहा है तो उसको कहना चाहिए भईया आप काम नहीं कर रहे हो और अगर 2-3 बार कहने के बाद काम नहीं किया तो फिर दूसरे को चांस देना चाहिए। और अंत में जो हमारे ही लोग हमारे खिलाफ खड़े हो जाते हैं चुनाव के समय इंडिपेंडेंट खड़े हो जाते हैं जो इंडिपेंडेंट को खड़ा कर देते हैं उनके खिलाफ एक्शन लेने की जरुरत है। आप सब ये चीजें जानते हैं मैं भी जानता हूं सब लोग जानते हैं कमी इंप्लिमेंटेशन में है और हम इंप्लिमेंटेशन अगर मिल के करेंगे, यहां पे ज्ञान है, जानकारी है हम ये काम कर सकते हैं और जिस दिन हमने ये काम कर दिया, हमारे सामने कोई नहीं खड़ा रह पायेगा। जिस दिन जनता की आवाज कांग्रेस पार्टी के अंदर गूंजने लगी, आज गूंजती है बाकियों से ज्यादा गूंजती है, मगर जिस दिन गहराई से गूंजने लेगेगी, जिस दिन पंचायत, वार्ड के लोग यहां आ के बैठ जायें उस दिन हमें कोई नहीं हरा पायेगा, और होगा क्या कि जो आज हमारे अंदर कभी-कभी गुस्सा आता है दुःख होता है, फ्रस्टेशन आती है वो कम हो जायेगा, मुस्कुराहटें आ जायेंगी, लोग कहेंगे भईया मजा आ रहा है विपक्षी पार्टियों को हराते हैं मजे से लड़ेंगे, मजे से जीतेंगे।
मैं पिछले 8 साल से ये काम कर रहा हूँ और मैंने आपसे कहा की अपने मुझे सिखाया है, senior नेता बैठे है कल मैंने ओला जी का भाषण सुना कितनी गहरी बात बोली उन्होंने और युवा भी थे उन्होंने ने भी गहरी बात बोली, Chidambaram जी थे और उन्होंने ने भी गहरी बात बोली, Antony जी थे उन्होंने ने गहरी बात बोली। यहाँ पे capability की कोई कमी नहीं है, गहराए की कोई कमी नहीं है और जिस प्रकार ये party सोचती है जितनी depth इस पार्टी में है और कही नहीं है। Parliament में देखता है सब जगह देखता है और मैं आपको ये बताना चाहता हूँ की मैं सब कुछ नहीं जनता हूँ, दुनिया मैं ऐसा कोई व्यक्ति नहीं जो सब कुछ जनता हो। मगर अगर आपसे पूछा Congress party मैं करोडों लोग हैं कही न कही जानकारी ज़रूर हैं, मैं आपसे ये कहना चाहता हूँ की मैं उस जानकारी को ढूंढूंगा। senior नेताओ से पूछूंगा, Sheila जी यहाँ बैठी, Gehlot जी बैठे है, Alvi जी बैठे है,बहुत सरे जिनके नाम नहीं ले सकता हूँ उन सब से पूछूंगा और आपसे सीखूंगा क्युकी इस party का इतिहास आपके अन्दर है, इस party की सोच आपके अन्दर है और मैं सिर्फ आपकी आवाज़ को आगे बढ़ाऊंगा , जो सुनायी देंगा उससे आगे बढ़ाऊंगा और fairness की बात होती है, कल मैंने meeting मैं कहा की कचेरी में दो लोग होते है एक lawyer होता है दूसरा judge होता है, मैं judge का काम करूँगा lawyer का काम नहीं करूँगा। अब मैं वापस थोडा अंग्रेजी मैं बोलना चाहता हूँ क्यूंकी south India के लोग कह रहे होंगे..तमिल तो मैं बोल नहीं सकता। तो थोडा मैं आपको अब इमोशनल बात कहना चाहता हूँ दिल की बात कहना चाहता हूँ।

I am optimistic because we have already put the building blocks of the revolution in place, and to a big degree I would like to thank the Congress president, the Prime Minister and the Congress party for putting these building blocks in place. Let me tell you what these building blocks are, first of all India is more connected today than it is ever being, we have the networks of roads, information, communication, people and media for new idea to immerge for them to develop and take flight. It is no longer possible to limit an idea whose time has come. Aadhaar, let me speak about Aaadhar, it gives us unprecedented mechanism to recognize the unique journey of aspiration of every single India no matter where he is. Direct cash transfer, is going to allow us to respond to these dreams with an empowering delivering system. My father use to speak about 15 paisa to the rupee reaching the people and we today are preparing the system that is going to answer that question, we are going to answer that question and 99% of people need money can go to them, it is a revolution, it is a revolution and no other country has done it and we are preparing that revolution
Congress is giving the people they due is now called it bribing the country , they say that because they scared , they understand what Aadhaar can do.. they understand what cash transfers can do.. and most importantly they understand what people in the Congress party , what the thinking in the Congress party can do.. Panchayati Raj and women self have improvement , they given the platform for democracy the balance of national decisions…..must shift away to Delhi and the state capitals to the Panchayat and to the world and Congress party must continued to way to eventual battle to overcome social presidium and discrimination against women, dalit , minorities and tribes I am optimistic because of the buildings block ….. but am most optimistic and excited because I see the energy, the passion and capability in our youth , bringing to respond to their urgent demand for jobs now, our institutions , learning and training must first informed us to repairing youth in scales for best jobs in scale for the best job in the world , equally decisions that matter to creating jobs need to be further liberated irrational red tape and outdated laws.

But there are many challenges ahead. The voices of the billion Indians are today that they want to greater say in government, in politics and in administration.
This can't be decided by hand full of people behind closed doors who are not fully accountable to them. They are telling us that India's governmental system is stuck in the past it is become a system that robs people of their voice, a system that dis-empowers instead of empowering. But why we are in this situation, why is it I ask you, that our ministries do the work of Panchayats. Why is it the Supreme Court handles the load of lower houses of justice? Why is it that the CMs need to appoint a teacher? Why is it that a VCs chosen by people who far removed from their education systems? No matter what state you look at, No matter which political party you look at why do a handful of people control the entire political space?
Power is grossly centralized in our country we only empower people at the top of a system. We don't believe in empowering people all the way to bottom. Every single day I meet people who has tremendous understanding deep insight and no voice and all of us meet them, they are very where. But almost always they are kept outside ours systems, no one can their voice, no matter how much they try to speak no one listens. And then I meet people holding high positions with tremendous voice but no understanding for the issues at hand. Why this happens is because we don't respect knowledge.
And it does not matter how much wisdom you have.. you mean nothing.. This is the tragedy of India..

Please watch and share video
Congress president Sonia Gandhi ji, Pradhan Mantri Dr Manmohan Singh ji, members of the Congress Working Committee, PCC presidents and chief ministers of states and Rajasthan, AICC members, delegates of the Chintan Shivir, friends, I would like to welcome all of you here and thank you very much for all the support you have shown to me.
There are a lot of our workers who are not here today. I would also like to thank them for the work they do and for the blood and sweat they give to this party.
Before I begin, I would like to state that this is a huge honour for me. Over the last 8 years, this party has taught me a tremendous amount. I have learnt from the senior leaders and the youngsters of this party and I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for all the help and direction you have given me.
There are people in south India who would like me to speak in English and there are people in North India and as is the tradition, I will speak in English and then I will speak in Hindi.
In 1947 India was liberated not by arms but by unleashing the voice of our people, other countries fought violently, other countries fought with weapons, other countries fought with death, India fought with non-violence and with voice.
Everybody told us that it can be done; everybody told us that if you want to get rid of British you have to use violence and the Congress party said no we are not going to use violence and we defeated the biggest empire of its time and we send them home. This was energy behind of freedom movement voices million and millions of our voices.
Gandhi ji success us led by Jawaharlal Nehru feed the voice of every Indian by ensuring the democracy became the better of our constitution. Relentlessly championing the voice of every Indian will always be the essence of the Congress party and not a Indian one caste or one religion I would like to repeated every single Indian is going to be supported.
No matter who he is, if he is Indian we work for him. Let's look at the last 60 years of India's successes. They have all come when we gave up the people voice. The Green revolution, to restore the voice of the farmer, bank nationalisation to restore the voice of the poor and the market for credit. The IT and telecom revolutions literally gave the people voice, millions of people's voice and if you have a cellphone in your pocket today it is result of that revolution.
And it's an honour that Manmohan Singh ji is sitting here because he spearheaded another revolution in 1991, he unleash the voice of thousands in the field of entrepreneurship and change the country forever. The UPA government is followed Gandhiji's model. It is created the platforms for those denied their voice in the political system, for the first time in our history our people is being guaranteed their basic rights, social and economic heads. The Food Bill will ensure that true mother sees her child go hungry at night, the RTI allows every single Indian to personally take on the battle against corruption. MGNREGA is given millions of Indians pride in their work, right to education enables every child to aspire to greatness. All of these radical innovations were possible only because of the growth provided by the Congress party and the UPA. But there are many challenges ahead. The voices of the billion Indians are today that they want to greater say in government, in politics and in administration.
This can't be decided by hand full of people behind closed doors who are not fully accountable to them. They are telling us that India's governmental system is stuck in the past it is become a system that robs people of their voice, a system that dis-empowers instead of empowering. But why we are in this situation, why is it I ask you, that our ministries do the work of Panchayats. Why is it the Supreme Court handles the load of lower houses of justice? Why is it that the CMs need to appoint a teacher? Why is it that a VCs chosen by people who far removed from their education systems? No matter what state you look at, No matter which political party you look at why do a handful of people control the entire political space?
Power is grossly centralized in our country we only empower people at the top of a system. We don't believe in empowering people all the way to bottom. Every single day I meet people who has tremendous understanding deep insight and no voice and all of us meet them, they are very where. But almost always they are kept outside ours systems, no one can their voice, no matter how much they try to speak no one listens. And then I meet people holding high positions with tremendous voice but no understanding for the issues at hand. Why this happens is because we don't respect knowledge.
And it does not matter how much wisdom you have.. you mean nothing.. This is the tragedy of India.. Why is our youth angry.. why are they out on the street.. They are angry because they are alienated… They are excluded from the political class. They watch from the sidelines.. as the powerful drive around in their lal battis… Why are the women suffering.. because their voice is being trampled upon by people who have arbitrary powers over their lives. Why are the poor confined to powerlessness and poverty.. because decision the decision over their lives.. and the services they need… are decided by people far away, answerable to them only in theory.. until we start to respect and empower people for knowledge and understand, we cant change anything in this country… All our public systems, administration.. justice… education.. political systems.. all of them… are designed to keep people with knowledge out.. They are all closed systems.. They are designed to promote mediocrity… and mediocrity dominates.. mediocrity dominates discussion while the voice of insight and thought are crushed by loudness of those who have neither the understanding nor compassion.. success in these systems does not come through building… it comes by excluding.. it comes not by pushing people forward… but by holding people back…
To maintain the status quo. We do not praise our colleagues or look at their strength and all of us every single of one us does it. We won't praise other people. We ask them bhaiya what is your weakness. We only look out the way to neutralize them and every single day all of us a face with the hypocrisy of the system. We all see it and then we pretend it is not there. People who are corrupt stand up and talk about eradicating corruption… and then people who disrespect women every day over day of their life… talk about women rights. Until we start to respect the empowered people for their knowledge, for their understanding we are never going to change this country. We need the aam admi to participate in our politics . Even when as I speak their future is decided in the disclosed room. There is an young and impatient India and it is demanding the voice in the nation future. Let me tell you they are not going to watch silently. Our priorities are clear. The time has come to question the centralized on responsive and on accountable system, decision making and governance, administration and politics. The answer not to people say we need to run the system better.. The answer is not in running this system better.
We have to re-look at things in system and we have to transform them completely… yet I am optimistic, I am not pessimistic, and I am going to tell you why I am optimistic I am optimistic because we have already put the building blocks of the revolution in place, and to a big degree I would like to thank the Congress president, the Prime Minister and the Congress party for putting these building blocks in place. Let me tell you what these building blocks are, first of all India is more connected today than it is ever being, we have the networks of roads, information, communication, people and media for new idea to immerge for them to develop and take flight. It is no longer possible to limit an idea whose time has come. Aadhaar, let me speak about Aaadhar, it gives us unprecedented mechanism to recognize the unique journey of aspiration of every single India no matter where he is. Direct cash transfer, is going to allow us to respond to these dreams with an empowering delivering system. My father use to speak about 15 paisa to the rupee reaching the people and we today are preparing the system that is going to answer that question, we are going to answer that question and 99% of people need money can go to them, it is a revolution, it is a revolution and no other country has done it and we are preparing that revolution
Congress is giving the people they due is now called it bribing the country , they say that because they scared , they understand what Aadhaar can do.. they understand what cash transfers can do.. and most importantly they understand what people in the Congress party , what the thinking in the Congress party can do.. Panchayati Raj and women self have improvement , they given the platform for democracy the balance of national decisions…..must shift away to Delhi and the state capitals to the Panchayat and to the world and Congress party must continued to way to eventual battle to overcome social presidium and discrimination against women, dalit , minorities and tribes I am optimistic because of the buildings block ….. but am most optimistic and excited because I see the energy, the passion and capability in our youth , bringing to respond to their urgent demand for jobs now, our institutions , learning and training must first informed us to repairing youth in scales for best jobs in scale for the best job in the world , equally decisions that matter to creating jobs need to be further liberated irrational red tape and outdated laws. So that the tremendous energy of India youth will be fully unleashed अब में थोडा हिंदी में संगठन के बारे में बोलना चाहता हूँ अपने मुझे ये बहुत बड़ी ज़िम्मेदारी दी है.. और ये पार्टी कहलाती है पर सचमुच में यह एक हम परिवार है इस बात को आप मानते है यह हिंदुस्तान का शायद दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा परिवार है और इसमे में हिंदुस्तान में सब लोग अन्दर आ सकते है आप को क्या लगता है बदलाव की जरुरत है ......तेज़ी से बदलाव की जरुरत है मगर सोच समझ के बदलाव की जरुरत है और सबको एक साथ लेकर बदलाव की बात करनी है और बदलाव लाना है प्यार से करना है सोच समझकर करना है और आपकी आवाज़ को सुनकर करना है समझ कर करना है में पहले यूथ कांग्रेस का जनरल सेक्रेटेरी हुआ करता था ,एन एस यु आई का जनरल सेक्रेटेरी हुआ करता था अब में कांग्रेस पार्टी में vice प्रेजिडेंट हूँ आपको यह लगना नहीं चाहिए की राहुल गाँधी युवाओ की बात करता है राहुल गाँधी का परिवार यूथ कांग्रेस , एन एस यु आई , कांग्रेस पार्टी ,महिला कांग्रेस सबके सब है और आज से राहुल गाँधी सबके लिए काम करेगा और सबको .......कांग्रेस पार्टी राहुल गाँधी और सबको में आपको वायदा करना चाहता हूँ ...सुनिए सुनिए और में आपसे वायदा करता हूँ..
एक ही आंख से एक ही तरीके से देखूंगा... चाहे वो यूथ कांग्रस का हो चाहे वो बुजुर्ग हो, चाहे unexperience हो, experienced हो, महिला हो जो भी हो जो आप कहेंगे मै से सुनूंगा और समझने की कोशिश करूंगा राजहनीति में मैं 8 9 साल से हूं और मैं एक बात समझा हूं काम करना है सोच समझ कर करना है गहराई से करना है और जल्दी से नही करना है बदलाव हो तो लम्बे तौर पर हो ऐर गहराई से हो एक दो चीजें मैं आप से कहना चाहता हूं.. बदलाव की बात आपने कही.. नीयम और कानून की बात मैं कहना चाहता हूं.. कांग्रस पार्टी एक ऐसा संगठन है दुनियां का सबसे बड़ा राजनीतिक संगठन है मगर इसमें नियम और कानून नही चलते हैं... शायद एक भी नियम और कानून इस पार्टी में नहीं है हम हर दो मिनट नये नियम बनाते हैं पुराने नियम दबा देते हैं और यहां शायद किसी को भी नहीं मालूम कांग्रस पार्टी के नियम किया है। मज़ेदार संगठन है कभी कभी पूछता हूं मैं अपना आप से कि भैया ये चलता कैसे है ये election कैसे जीतता है.. ये बाकी पार्टीयों का खत्म कैसे कर देता है... समझ नही आती है बात मगर election के बाद धड़ाक से कांग्रेस पार्टी जीत गई.. वर्कर खड़ा हो गया नेता खड़े हो गए... शीला जी मुझे कह रही थी कि भैया पता नही क्या होता है कि election के पहले सब खड़े हो जाते हैं और धड़ाके से लड़ जाते हैं.........
इसमें हिन्दुस्तान का DNA भरा है। और जो हमारे विपक्षी दल हैं वो समझतें नहीं हैं इस बात को। वो देखतें हैं और कहतें हैं कि ये हो क्या रहा है। कोई कहता है कि हम किसी एक जात की पार्टी है.. कोई कहता की मैं किसी एक धर्म की पार्टी हूं.. और कांग्रेस पार्टी कहती है कि हमारी DNA तो हिन्दुस्तान की है। हम न जात पहचानतें हैं..न धर्म पहचानतें हैं.. हम सिर्फ हिन्दुस्तान की DNA पहचानतें हैं.. सबके सब है।
तो नीयम और कानून की जरुरत है.. पहली बात.. दूसरी बात.. हम leadership development पर focus नहीं करते। आज से 5-6 साल बात ऐसी बात होनी चाहिए कि अगर किसी state में हमें chief minister की जरुरत हो.. तो जैसे पहले photo हुआ करती थी.. 40 फोटो हुआ करती थी कांग्रेस पार्टी की... नहरु जी.. पटेल.. आजाद.. giants हुआ करते थे.. उनमे से कोई भी देश का प्रधान मंत्री बन सकता था.. ये बात हमने करनी है.. हमें 40-50 नेता तैयार करने हैं.. जो देश को चला सकें.. सिर्फ प्रदेश को नहीं.. देश को चला सकें.. 40-50 नेता ऐसे तैयार करने हैं हर प्रदेश में.. हमारे पास 5-6-7-10 ऐसे नेता हों जो chief minister बन सकें। और हर district में ये बात हो.. हर block में यह बात हो.. और अगर हमसे कोई पूछे की कांग्रेस पार्टी क्या करती है.. कांग्रेस पार्टी हिन्दुस्तान के भविष्य के लिए नेता तैयार करती है.. कांग्रेस पार्टी सेक्यूलर नेता, ऐसे नेता जो गहराई से हिन्दुस्तान को समझते हैं, जो जनता से जुड़े हुए हैं वैसे नेता तैयार करती है। ऐसे नेता तैयार करती है, जिनको हिन्दुस्तान के सब लोग देख कर कहते हैं भईया हम इनके पीछे खड़ा होना चाहते हैं। तो लीडरशिप डेवलपमेंट की जरुरत है और इसके लिये ढांचे की जरुरत है सिस्टम की जरुरत है इंफार्मेशन की जरुरत है क्योंकि यहां पे जो नहीं होता है, इसलिये नहीं होता है कि कोई चाहता नहीं है, इसलिये नहीं होता है कि कोई सिस्टम नहीं है और सिस्टम बनाया जा सकता है और इस सिस्टम को आप लोग बनाओगे और आप लोग चलाओगे। हम टिकट की बात करते हैं, जमीन पे हमारा कार्यकर्ता काम करता है यहां हमारे डिस्ट्रिक्ट प्रेसिडेंट बैठे हैं, ब्लॉक प्रेसिडेंट्स हैं ब्लॉक कमेटीज हैं डिस्ट्रिक्ट कमेटीज हैं उनसे पूछा नहीं जाता, हैं यहां डिस्ट्रिक्ट प्रेसिडेंट? हैं। टिकट के समय उनसे नहीं पूछा जाता, संगठन से नहीं पूछा जाता, ऊपर से डिसीजन लिया जाता है भईया इसको टिकट मिलना चाहिए, होता क्या है दूसरे दलों के लोग आ जाते हैं चुनाव के पहले आ जाते हैं, नहीं सुनो, सुनो। आ जाते हैं, चुनाव हार जाते हैं और फिर चले जाते हैं और हमारा कार्यकर्ता कहता है भईया, वो ऊपर देखता है चुनाव से पहले ऊपर देखता है, ऊपर से पैराशूट गिरता है धड़ाक! नेता आता है, दूसरी पार्टी से आता है चुनाव लड़ता है फिर हवाई जहाज में उड़ के चला जाता है।
सबसे पहले कांग्रेस पार्टी के कार्यकर्ता की इज्जत होनी चाहिए और सिर्फ कार्यकर्ता की इज्जत नहीं, नेताओं की इज्जत, नेताओं की इज्जत का मतलब क्या है? कि अगर नेता ने अच्छा काम किया है, अगर नेता जनता के लिये काम कर रहा है चाहे वह जूनियर नेता हो या सीनियर नेता हो, जितना भी छोटा हो, जितना भी बड़ा हो अगर वो काम कर रहा है तो उसे आगे बढ़ाना चाहिए, अगर वो काम नहीं कर रहा है तो उसको कहना चाहिए भईया आप काम नहीं कर रहे हो और अगर 2-3 बार कहने के बाद काम नहीं किया तो फिर दूसरे को चांस देना चाहिए। और अंत में जो हमारे ही लोग हमारे खिलाफ खड़े हो जाते हैं चुनाव के समय इंडिपेंडेंट खड़े हो जाते हैं जो इंडिपेंडेंट को खड़ा कर देते हैं उनके खिलाफ एक्शन लेने की जरुरत है। आप सब ये चीजें जानते हैं मैं भी जानता हूं सब लोग जानते हैं कमी इंप्लिमेंटेशन में है और हम इंप्लिमेंटेशन अगर मिल के करेंगे, यहां पे ज्ञान है, जानकारी है हम ये काम कर सकते हैं और जिस दिन हमने ये काम कर दिया, हमारे सामने कोई नहीं खड़ा रह पायेगा। जिस दिन जनता की आवाज कांग्रेस पार्टी के अंदर गूंजने लगी, आज गूंजती है बाकियों से ज्यादा गूंजती है, मगर जिस दिन गहराई से गूंजने लेगेगी, जिस दिन पंचायत, वार्ड के लोग यहां आ के बैठ जायें उस दिन हमें कोई नहीं हरा पायेगा, और होगा क्या कि जो आज हमारे अंदर कभी-कभी गुस्सा आता है दुःख होता है, फ्रस्टेशन आती है वो कम हो जायेगा, मुस्कुराहटें आ जायेंगी, लोग कहेंगे भईया मजा आ रहा है विपक्षी पार्टियों को हराते हैं मजे से लड़ेंगे, मजे से जीतेंगे।
मैं पिछले 8 साल से ये काम कर रहा हूँ और मैंने आपसे कहा की अपने मुझे सिखाया है, senior नेता बैठे है कल मैंने ओला जी का भाषण सुना कितनी गहरी बात बोली उन्होंने और युवा भी थे उन्होंने ने भी गहरी बात बोली, Chidambaram जी थे और उन्होंने ने भी गहरी बात बोली, Antony जी थे उन्होंने ने गहरी बात बोली। यहाँ पे capability की कोई कमी नहीं है, गहराए की कोई कमी नहीं है और जिस प्रकार ये party सोचती है जितनी depth इस पार्टी में है और कही नहीं है। Parliament में देखता है सब जगह देखता है और मैं आपको ये बताना चाहता हूँ की मैं सब कुछ नहीं जनता हूँ, दुनिया मैं ऐसा कोई व्यक्ति नहीं जो सब कुछ जनता हो। मगर अगर आपसे पूछा Congress party मैं करोडों लोग हैं कही न कही जानकारी ज़रूर हैं, मैं आपसे ये कहना चाहता हूँ की मैं उस जानकारी को ढूंढूंगा। senior नेताओ से पूछूंगा, Sheila जी यहाँ बैठी, Gehlot जी बैठे है, Alvi जी बैठे है,बहुत सरे जिनके नाम नहीं ले सकता हूँ उन सब से पूछूंगा और आपसे सीखूंगा क्युकी इस party का इतिहास आपके अन्दर है, इस party की सोच आपके अन्दर है और मैं सिर्फ आपकी आवाज़ को आगे बढ़ाऊंगा , जो सुनायी देंगा उससे आगे बढ़ाऊंगा और fairness की बात होती है, कल मैंने meeting मैं कहा की कचेरी में दो लोग होते है एक lawyer होता है दूसरा judge होता है, मैं judge का काम करूँगा lawyer का काम नहीं करूँगा। अब मैं वापस थोडा अंग्रेजी मैं बोलना चाहता हूँ क्यूंकी south India के लोग कह रहे होंगे..तमिल तो मैं बोल नहीं सकता। तो थोडा मैं आपको अब इमोशनल बात कहना चाहता हूँ दिल की बात कहना चाहता हूँ।
This morning I got up at night, 4 O'clock in the morning I got out into the balcony I thought ""Now you have a big responsibility in front of you and this people are standing behind you, people are standing on your side."" It was dark and it was cold and I had decided I am not going to tell you only what you wanted to hear, I decided I goanna tell you little bit about what I feel, I want tell you about hope, and also want to tell you about power.
When I was a little boy I loved to play badminton. I loved it because it gives me balance in a complicated world. I was taught how to play in my grandmother's house by two police men who protected my grandmother. They were my friends, then one day they killed my grandmother and took way the balance in my life. I felt pain that I never felt before and many of us have experienced this so you will understand what I am saying.
My father was in Bengal and he came back the hospital was dark green and dirty. And there was a huge crowd screaming outside they were very angry and as we entered they were screaming and shouting. It was the first time in my life that I saw my father was crying, he was the bravest person I knew and yet I saw him crying.
I was small but I could see my father was broken, he had taken away his mother and he was broken. In those days our country wasn't what it is today. In the eyes of the world we had nothing. We were worthless. We didn't have money, we didn't have cars, everybody said were a poor country. Nobody thought about us. Same evening I was my father addressing the nation on television. I knew like me he was broken inside and even like me he was terrified of what lay in front of him but when he spoke that night I felt the small glimmer of hope. It was like a small ray of light in a dark sky. I can still remember what it felt like. If you think back lot of you will also remember this. The next day I realized that many people had seen it. Today as I look back and I has a political career of 8 years in 42 years I can see it was a small ray of hope in the darkness that helped changed India into what I is today. Without hope you can not achieve anything. You can have plans, you can have ideas, but unless you have hope you can not change anything. I want to talk to you about power.
Last night every single one of you congratulated me, many of you came and hugged me and congratulated me. Everybody congratulated me but last night my mother came to my room and she cried, why did she cried? she cried because she understand that the power so many people seek its actually a poison she can see it , what it does to a people around and to the people they love but the most important that she can see it, she not attached to it, the only anti poked to this poison is for all of us to see it for what it is really is and not become attached to it, we should not chased power for attribute to some power, we should only use it to empower voices. In our work it is my mother experience for the life time it is my experience for 8 years and am sure many of you to deal with power every day, understand what I am saying and realize the positive and the negative, and we must not forget that there is negative, that you have to be very careful when you doing administer power, when you use power, today India is not like what it was in 1984.
We are no longer seen as worthless.
Today the entire world is courting us.. Today we are the future.. and as I said before nations are not build on scheme and plans. They are raised on a foundation of hope. I am standing here because I believe that Congress party is the symbol of this hope and has the potential to embody it. I like to end again by saying that for me the Congress party is now my life. The people of India my life and I will fight for the people of India and for this party. I will fight with everything I have and I invite all of you to stand up and take on this fight.

Angry at the beheading of Indian soldier on Line of Control, Army Chief Gen Bikram Singh today issued a clear warning to Pakistan saying India reserves the right to retaliate at the ""time and place"" of its choosing.

Talking tough over the January 8 incident in Mendhar area of Jammu and Kashmir, he said the beheading was ""unacceptable"" and ""most unpardonable"" and the troops would respond immediately, aggressively and offensively if provoked.

Slamming Pakistan for planting lies to justify the ""pre-meditated and pre-planned"" cross-LoC attack, he said Pakistan army's commando unit SSG had carried out the assault.

He did not rule out the possibility of Lashker-e-Taiba terrorists providing help to Pakistan army in the assault in which two Indian soldiers were killed, one of them beheaded.
""It (beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj) is unacceptable and unpardonable. It is barbaric. It defies all logic. It is against the very rules of engagement. It is against the ethics of soldiering... We are annoyed,"" the Army Chief said addressing a press conference on the eve of Army Day.

He revealed that Pakistani army had beheaded two Indian soldiers earlier also. ""Yes, this has happened. We cannot conceal this fact,"" he said when asked whether two jawans of Kumaon regiment had been beheaded by Pakistani army over a year back.

Asserting that the Pakistani army ""needs to be accountable"", he said, ""we reserve the right to retaliate at the time and place of our choosing.""

Replying to a volley of questions during the nearly two-hour interaction, Gen Singh said he expected the Indian commanders ""to be aggressive and offensive in the face of provocation. I don't expect my commanders to be timid... We shall not be passive when fire at. Therefore, when fired at, when provoked, we shall respond.""

Rollout of Direct Benefits Transfer to begin from Today - 1 January 2013 | A decision was taken in the meeting of the National Committee on Direct Cash Transfers held by the Prime Minister that Direct Benefit Transfers will be rolled out from 1 January 2013 in 43 identified districts. The purpose of Direct Benefits Transfer is to ensure that benefits go to individuals bank accounts electronically, cutting down delays and diversions.

A lot of preparatory has been done and a lot of work is ongoing in connection with the rollout. Secretaries and their officers have visited all 43 districts to assess the preparedness for rollout of Direct Benefits Transfer. A meeting of District Collectors was held on 13 December 2012 to inform them about the steps to be taken for timely rollout of Direct Benefits Transfer. Review meetings have been taken by the Prime Minister to ensure preparations are moving ahead smoothly.

What is Direct Benefits Transfer and what does it cover:

1. Government will transfer cash benefits like scholarships, pensions, NREGA wages, etc. directly to the Bank or Post Office Accounts of identified beneficiaries under the Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) programme. The shift to this would done in a phased, time-bound manner after ensuring that the necessary systems are in place for Direct Benefits Transfer.

2. Direct Benefits Transfer will not be a substitute for delivery of public services which would continue to take place as per the normal delivery channels.

3. Direct Benefits Transfer will not replace food with cash under the Public Distribution System. The Government is committed to legislating the National Food Security Act.


What does Rollout on 1.1.2013 mean in practice:

4. For the rollout beginning on 1.1.2013, 43 districts in 16 States have been identified for the first round of Direct Benefits Transfer under 26 selected schemes. The selection of 43 districts has been done on the basis of coverage of bank accounts and Aadhaar.

5. The rollout has been phased based on:

(a) The next instalment being due either on 1.1.2013 or at a later date.
(b) The list of beneficiaries being digitized in the district concerned.
(c) The opening of bank accounts for beneficiaries in the district concerned.
(d) Enrolment for Aadhaar numbers in the district concerned.
(e) Seeding of bank accounts with Aadhaar numbers in the district concerned.
(f) Availability of funds.

6. Based on the level of preparedness and the ongoing nature of the rollout, Direct Benefits Transfer will begin to take place from 1st January, 2013 as follows:

i. There will be a Direct Benefit Transfer on 1.1.2013 through a cash transfer into beneficiaries' bank accounts in 7 schemes. These schemes are spread over districts as below:
a.Post-matric scholarship for SC students - 7 districts; 48,000 beneficiaries
(Puducherry, Nawanshahr, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Anantpur, East Godavari, Diu)
b. Pre-matric scholarship for SC students - 1 district; 24,000 beneficiaries
(East Godavari)
c. Post-matric scholarship for OBC students - 6 districts; 105,000 beneficiaries (Puducherry, Alwar, Anantpur, East Godavari, Daman, North Goa)
d. Post-matric scholarship for ST students - 3 districts; 4,800 beneficiaries
(Tumkur, Waynad, Harda)
e. Indira Gandhi Matrutva Sahayata Yojana - 6 districts; 55,000 beneficiaries (Dharwar, Puducherry, NW Delhi, Diu, North Goa, Amaravati)
f. Dhanalakshmi Scheme - 1 district; 8,000 beneficiaries
(Fatehgarh Sahib)
g. Stipend to trainees under the scheme of welfare of SC/ST job seekers through Coaching-cum-Guidance and Vocational Training - 10 States, 650 beneficiaries
(Karnataka, Kerala, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, MP, Rajasthan, AP, Maharashtra, Jharkhand)

On 1.1.2013, over 2 lakh beneficiaries will start receiving benefits through Direct Benefits Transfer.

ii. In 20 of the 43 districts, all future benefits transfers under all the 26 schemes, whenever they are due after 1.1.2013 as per their cycle, will be through Direct Benefits Transfer. There will be some phased rollout in a few schemes in some of these districts. In a sense, these 20 districts go ""live"" for Direct Benefits Transfer from 1.1.2013.


iii. In 11 of the 43 districts, all future benefits transfers under all the 26 schemes, whenever they are due after 1.2.2013 as per their cycle, will be through Direct Benefits Transfer. In a sense, these 11 districts go ""live"" for Direct Benefits Transfer from 1.2.2013.

iv. In the remaining 12 of the 43 districts, all future benefits transfers under all the 26 schemes, whenever they are due after 1.3.2013 as per their cycle, will be through Direct Benefits Transfer. In a sense, these 12 districts go ""live"" for Direct Benefits Transfer from 1.3.2013.

v. By 1.3.2013, Phase 1 of Direct benefits Transfer would have rolled out in all 43 districts and all benefits would be flowing electronically to beneficiaries accounts in the 43 districts as and when their payments become due.

7. It may be the case that not all 26 schemes may be present in all the 43 districts. Further, under some of the 26 schemes, the next installment will be due only next financial year.

Other Arrangements for Direct Benefits Transfer

8. Direct Benefits Transfer from the Centre will take place either directly to the account of the beneficiary or through the State Government into the account of the beneficiary.

9. Withdrawal arrangements are being strengthened. Initially beneficiaries will be able to withdraw from their own bank branches or ATMs or Business Correspondents (BCs) wherever they exist. The system of micro-ATMs and multiple BCs will roll out subsequently with full inter-operability gradually. The one lakh Common Service Centers set up by the Department of IT are being engaged to serve as a BC in Gram Panchayats where BCs are not functional today. Banks have also been asked to expand their reach to provide banking services to every 1000-1500 households through a BC or CSC. Work is being done to make the BCs interoperable over a period of time. Banks have floated a tender for 20 lakh Micro-ATMs which will be inter-operable and will have facility for biometric scanning and Aadhaar authentication.


Next Steps in Rollout

10. Once the programme has stabilized in these 43 districts, it will be rolled out in phases in other parts of the country over 2013 after a careful assessment of readiness.

11. Direct Transfer of Subsidies for food, fertilizer and kerosene is not being contemplated at present. This will take more time as the issues of entitlement are more complex.",Union Minister Shri P.

Mr. Gujral, who migrated from Pakistan after partition, rose to become the Prime Minister, starting as Vice President in NDMC in the '50s to later become a Union Minister and then India's Ambassador to the USSR.

After a stint in the New Delhi Municipal Corporation as Vice Chairman, he caught the eye of Indira Gandhi and became a minister of state and held various portfolios between 1967 and 1976. He held positions like Communications and Parliamentary Affairs, Information and Broadcasting, Housing and Planning.

Mr. Gujral, an intellectual who propounded the 'Gujral Doctrine' of five principles for maintaining good neighbourly relations, left the Congress to join the Janata Dal in the late-1980s.

He became Minister of External Affairs in the V.P. Singh-led National Front government in 1989. As the External Affairs Minister he handled the fallout of the Kuwait crisis following Iraqi invasion that displaced thousands of Indians.

Mr. Gujral had a second stint as External Affairs Minister in the United Front government under H.D. Deve Gowda, whom he later replaced as Prime Minister after the Congress withdrew support in 1997.

One study estimates the costs and benefits of Aadhaar. We find that substantial benefits would accrue to the government by integrating Aadhaar with schemes such as PDS, MNREGS, fertiliser and LPG subsidies, as well as housing, education and health programmes. The benefits arise from the reduction in leakages that occur due to identification and authentication issues. Our analysis takes into account the costs of developing and maintaining Aadhaar, and of integrating Aadhaar with the schemes over the next ten years. Even after taking all costs into account, and making modest assumptions about leakages, of about 7-12 percent of the value of the transfer/subsidy, we find that the Aadhaar project would yield an internal rate of return of 52.85 percent to the government.

The nationwide cash transfer scheme that aims to put a total of Rs 3.2 lakh crore per year in the bank accounts of 10 crore poor families, starts January next year. 
The per family/per year cash transfer amount will be Rs 32,000, almost three times the average annual earning of a below-the-poverty-line (BPL) family. The cash transfer will replace subsidies for kerosene, LPG, small pension payments as well as wages from job guarantee schemes. 
This means, according to senior officials in the PMO who spoke on condition of anonymity, the cash transfer scheme will be ""fiscally neutral"" since existing indirect subsidies will be replaced by direct cash transfers. 
PMO officials said the ""big difference"" in this welfare reform will be a ""huge spending impact on the economy"" - poor families will have much more cash at their disposal. Massive in administrative scope and political ambition, the rollout is expected to be completed by April 2014, just in time for the scheduled general elections - the formal announcement will be made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday. 

Singh will chair a meeting of the national committee on direct cash transfers before greenlighting the scheme. The committee's members are the ministers of finance, rural development, HRD, labour, petroleum, fertiliser and women and child welfare, as well as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and the chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI), Nandan Nilekani. 

The showpiece welfare reform has the full backing of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, senior party officials said, requesting they not be named. Congress strategists are looking at cash transfers as the 'NREG of UPA-II', a senior leader said. 

However, many senior officials in the government, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the success of this massive welfare reform was critically contingent on Aadhaar, the electronic platform-based system for providing unique identification numbers for all residents, covering at least 80% of the population. 

Aadhar is critical because the cash recipients' bank accounts will be opened on the basis of their identification number - a process designed to eliminate diversion of welfare cash to non-BPL residents. The Aadhar number is the means to making basic banking services accessible to the poor as well as ensuring there's no leakage during cash transfer. 

Aadhar's coverage has so far been limited to urban areas in the three years since its launch. ""As of now, we have enrolled 250 million, i.e. approximately one in every four Indians. The goal is to make it one in every three Indians by 2013, and by 2014, every second Indian will have an Aadhaar number.""

24967709920_10151233834929921,"Rahul in Himachal Pradesh:

Congress General Secretary on Thursday launched a strong attack against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government in Himachal Pradesh, saying that the state government's policies have hurt the poor and said only the Congress can bring inclusive development to the state.

He stated that while the Union Government has brought welfare schemes which were aimed at bringing inclusive growth, the BJP's policies were pro-rich. He said while the Congress-led UPA government in the centre had launched welfare schemes like the MNREGA, the state government was taking away the land of the poor and giving it to builders and indulging in corruption.

Shri Gandhi addressed three rallies on Thursday at Keylong, in Lahaul and Spiti, then at Kangra and finally in Solan. Large crowds turned out at all the three rallies to hear the Congress General Secretary.
Starting his day-long election campaign tour from Police Grounds at Keylong, the headquarters of the Lahaul & Spiti District, Shri Gandhi said while the union government has been sending money through central schemes, the state government has created a situation where a very small portion reaches its intended beneficiaries.

Taking on the state government on its anti-tribal policies, Shri Gandhi said former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was responsible for getting tribal status for the residents of Lahaul and Spiti and the Congress had made every effort to ensure the welfare of the tribal community in the state and the country. 

""It was only after this that the tribal sub-plan started. But what is the BJP trying to do? They are trying to bring this down further. They are reducing it from 9% to 8.5%,"" said Shri Gandhi, launching a direct attack against the BJP government.

Shri Gandhi stated that getting the tribal status had hugely benefited the people of Lahaul and Spiti and he quoted the Congress candidate as saying that it has been the single largest factor that has brought change to the area.

He stated that while the Congress is focusing on taking people forward, the state BJP government wanted to cut down on the whatever benefits they are presently getting, including their share in developmental spending.

Shri Gandhi clearly spelt out the difference in the approach of the Congress and BJP. ""We run a government that works for the welfare of the poor, a government that provides schemes like MNREGA while they run a government for the rich,"" he said.

Making a reference to the speedy work on the Rohtang tunnel, Shri Gandhi said while the Congress has been trying to connect the people of Lahaul and Spiti with the rest of the country, integrate them with the rest of India, the BJP government in the state has been working against the people.
Addressing a large gathering at Kangra, Shri Gandhi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party was opposed to the idea of a government working for the welfare of the aam admi. That is why it did not let the Parliament function. Disruption of the Parliament did not hurt the BJP. It hurt the common people,"" said Shri Gandhi.

He was critical of the BJP government in the state which, he said, had done nothing for the welfare of the people. ""The roads are in a terrible condition. They have not been repaired for years, and the money meant for construction and maintenance of roads is obviously not spent on what it should be,"" he pointed out.

In Solan, Shri Gandhi raised the issue of FDI in multi-brand retail, and how it would help Himachal's farmers. He said a lot of farmers in the region who were growing mushrooms would benefit from FDI in retail as storage facilities would significantly   improve, thereby ensuring that the crop grown by the farmer would not perish in adverse weather conditions.

Shri Gandhi said the Congress party was concerned about the poor, and that  it wanted to provide food to every citizen of this country. He asked the assembled people, if that was wrong thing to do.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151233834169921/?type=3,2012-10-29 21:12:32,1487,172,182,1487,0,0,0,0,0

I am delighted to be once again in this beautiful state of Kerala. The State festival of Onam has just passed and I wish all Keralites, both resident and non-resident, happiness and sustained prosperity in the coming year. Before I proceed further, let me extend a very warm welcome to our foreign dignitaries: members of the diplomatic community, and other distinguished participants from all parts of the world, who are present with us today.

I compliment my friend, the Chief Minister of Kerala Shri Oommen Chandy and the Government of Kerala, the CII and NASSCOM for organizing this mega event Emerging Kerala 2012- Global Connect. I am particularly happy that this is not a one-off event but the beginning of a process which would bring together government and corporate leaders, heads of regulatory institutions, economists, scholars and eminent men and women from various walks of life every two years to find ways and means and explore new pathways to make Kerala a power-house of sustained economic and social development.

This confluence of talent, expertise and experience could result in valuable strategic alliances with the potential to open up new and innovative avenues for fulfilling the aspirations of the people. It could lead to new partnerships that could help in building local capacities boosting local employment, adding value to local production and enhancing exports, thereby assisting the State in unleashing the vast latent potential of this creative state of Kerala. I wish this event all success for this year and also for the coming years.

In many ways Kerala is unique among the States of India. Its social and human development indicators are at par with many developed countries. It has abundant natural resources. Its human resources are of a very high quality. Because of its breathtaking natural beauty, rich culture heritage, magnificent cuisine and warm and friendly people, Kerala has carved a niche for itself in the world of tourism, attracting lakhs of domestic and international tourists every year.

These strengths, along with the Chief Minister's commitment to give a clean, transparent and effective administration to the people, should be leveraged and leveraged optimally to attract investment into the State. I am sure that initiatives like the present one would help in building a climate favourable to entrepreneurship in this process.

The people of this wonderful State are adventurous, known to go where opportunity lies to find employment, set up new enterprises and discover new frontiers. Long before globalization became a buzz-word, Kerala was connected to the rest of the world. A rich history of spice trade gave this beautiful State a global orientation many centuries back, even before Vasco-da-Gama landed off the coast of Kozhikode in 1498.

More than 2 million Keralites work outside India, in the Gulf countries and elsewhere. Remittances from Non-resident Keralites contribute significantly to the State's economy. This constitutes more than 22% of the GDP of the State. The contribution of the Non Resident Keralites can perhaps be said to be the backbone of the economy of Kerala and has been so for the last four decades.

It is therefore heartening to know that the Non Resident Keralites are now making investments in the State in projects like hotels, hospitals and shopping complexes thereby helping to create physical and social infrastructure and new employment opportunities for the people living in the State.

We need to build an enabling environment to facilitate such investment in every possible way and I am very pleased to hear the Honourable Chief Minister promise that that is precisely what he is determined to do. And I hope that this conference would find new pathways of doing so.

Our Government is committed to helping and adding to the initiatives of the State government for building an improved industrial infrastructure in the State. Tomorrow I will be laying the foundation stone for the Kochi Metro Rail Project for linking Aluva to Petta. Our Government has approved the project at a cost of over Rs. 5100 crore. When this project is completed, it would transform the face of the commercial capital of the State by easing the burden of traffic congestion.

During my visit to the State in February, 2011, I inaugurated the country's first International Container Trans-shipment Terminal at Vallarpadam; and the International Terminal Building at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The terminal at Vallarpadam has been planned to make Kochi one of the major trans-shipment points of the world, transforming it into an economic and logistical hub. There were some issues relating to the operationalization of this terminal on account of cabotage and customs operations. These issues have now been resolved. The Union Cabinet has recently decided to relax the cabotage restrictions particularly for Vallarpadam. I am now confident that our vision for this historic port will materialize soon and a major portion of India's container traffic would flow through this port.

There are several other projects that our UPA government has approved for Kerala in the last few years. I inaugurated the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala in 2009. The Brahmos Aerospace, Thiruvananthapuram was commissioned in 2007. A Rail Coach Factory has been announced for Palakkad. A mega central sector project for setting up of Liquid Natural Gas Regasification Terminal at Puthuvypeen in Cochin Post Trust is under implementation. When commissioned, it will improve the availability of natural gas for power, fisheries, and food processing industries in the State.

The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and the Indian Institute of Space Technology, which our UPA government has set up, are shaping into institutions of excellence. We have also set up the Central University in Kasargod. The demand for establishing an IIT in this state is under serious consideration of our Government.

The UPA government has encouraged and actively supported the efforts of Kerala to grow into a major investment hub. We will continue to do so. We would like the State to embark on a path of people-focused inclusive and sustainable development, driven by knowledge and innovation, and mindful of the environmental concerns.

Labour intensive light manufacturing has a strong comparative advantage in this State and all assistance needs to be given to the small and micro business enterprises. I appreciate that the State government under the distinguished leadership of Shri Oomen Chandy is fully alive to the need for rapidly building up infrastructure, which is so essential for rapid industrial growth.

I would urge the State government to derive maximum possible benefit from initiatives of the Central Government especially the National Skill Development Mission. This would go a long way in tapping the energies of Kerala's educated manpower.

I have no doubt in my mind that Kerala will be able to capitalize on its immense resources to emerge stronger as an important investment destination in our country. I wish the State government and its people all success in their endeavours for building a modern, industrialised and prosperous Kerala. With these words, I have great pleasure in inaugurating the 'Emerging Kerala-2012-Global Connect'.

ISRO's PSLV C21 rocket successfully blasted off into space on its 100th mission on a cloudy Sunday morning. 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was among the cheering congregation of officials, scientists and media persons at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.
On this journey, the PSLV C21 rocket ferried two dollar-paying foreign passengers – a French Earth observation satellite Spot 6 and a Japanese micro satellite Proiteres into polar orbit.

On Sunday, precisely at 9.52 minutes, the rocket lifted off with a deafening roar and thick orange flame powering its upward spiralling journey, amid much cheers and claps from hundreds of special guests from the government, scientific community and media representatives. Located some 80km north of Chennai, Sriharikota hosts the Satish Dhawan Space Centre from where ISRO carries of all the launches of its rockets that put satellites into orbit.
 
Hundreds of people living in and around the space centre crowded onto rooftops for a live show of the rocket launch, as they have been doing for the past several years. While the people were on their rooftops, Prime Minister watched the historic event from ISRO's mission control room as the PSLV rocket's latest edition hurtled away from earth.

Within minutes, the 230 ton rocket was out of the eyesight of the people, its movement being tracked on giant computer screens. After one minute, the ground control said the first stage was normal and in two minutes the second stage started, which was also normal. In three minutes, heat shied was separated. Scientists at the control room were tracking the performance and relaying it over public address system as Prime Minister listened to it in rapt attention. Plus five minutes: PS3 performance normal.

As minutes ticked by the scientific community awaited every stage with bated breath. The performance was normal, as expected. Prime minister was seen clapping when the third stage got seperated and fourth stage got fired. His deputy, junior minister in PMO, V Narayanswamy, was also seen sitting nearby, visibly happy.

""Dr Radhakrishnan and all members of ISRO family, I am delighted to witness the launch of PSLV carrying two foreign satellites. I congraulate the department of space on ISRO's 100th satellite launch. It is a milestone in our space programme,"" Manmohan Singh said.

India has overcome immense odds to set up world class facilities and achieve success in technology, the prime minister said.

Manmohan Singh said that the founding fathers of Indian space programme were right and he believed that ISRO would scale greater heights. He said the scientists have shown that India can afford to invest in high technology areas and hoped that the benefits reach the people at large. Space missions were not a loss for the country and the successes notched up by ISRO were a fitting answer to the questions posed by few whether a country like India could afford costly space programme, the prime minister said.

ISRO hairman, K Radhakrishnan, thanked each and every colleague for the successful launch before the prime minister began his short address to the august gathering.

The PSLV C21 was on its way to deliver Spot 6 and Proiteres into a 655km polar orbit inclined at an angle of 98.23 degrees to the equator. SPOT and Indian remote sensing satellites (launched earlier) are the two leading earth observation satellite series. SPOT 6 is the heaviest foreign satellite ever to have been launched by the ISRO, which has made launching satellites as a significant business activity earning precious foreign exchange to the country.

The PSLV C21 cost Rs 75 crore.
 
More important, it has established the country as a major player in the satellite launching business, which started in 1999 as an additional baggage when ISRO launched India's own satellite. So far, ISRO has launched 27 foreign satellites and the two of Sunday's total up its tally to 29.
 
India is also a major player in the space with a the largest number of remote sensing satellites that send back imagery in a variety of spatial resolutions – from more than meter ranging up to 500 meters. This rich collection of data also makes India an important player in the data market.
 
India has 12 remote sensing/earth observation satellites circling the earth which makes it a leader in remote sensind data market. – The 12 satellites are :TES, Resourcesat 1, Cartosat 1, 2, 2A and 2B, IMS 1, Risat-2, Oceansat 2, Resourcesat-2, Megha-Tropiques and Risat-1.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151158616619921/?type=3,2012-09-09 03:55:11,2076,180,732,2076,0,0,0,0,0
24967709920_10151158562284921,"Verghese Kurien, father of White Revolution, dies

He made the ordinary, neighbourhood 'doodhwala' (milkman) a key player in the country's struggle for economic development and progress at the grassroot level.
Verghese Kurien, the man who brought milk revolution in the country, died early on Sunday in Gujarat. He was instrumental in laying the foundation of democratic enterprises at the remote villages and farflung hamlets which ensured economic justice. And it was with people's voluntary participation.
Honoured as the architect of India's White Revolution, which catapulted India to be the world's largest milk producer, Kurien managed the feat in the 1970s at a time when it faced grim uncertainties over its food security.

Kurien, the founder-chairman of National Dairy Development Board (1965-98) and also chairman of Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF)(1973-2006), and also the Institute of Rural management (1979-2006), dedicated his life to the cause of empowering the humble Indian farmers through co-operatives, said current GCMMF managing director RS Sodhi.

""He strongly believed that by placing technology and professional management in the hands of the farmers, the living standards of millions of rural poor could be improved,"" Sodhi said on Sunday in a tribute to Kurien's management skills.

Born on November 26, 1921 in Kozhikode, Kerala, Kurien - who was destined to become India's top 'milkman' - graduated from Loyola College in 1940 and later completed his engineering from Guindy College of Engineering, Chennai. But it was after a brief stint at TISCO that he obtained a government of India scholarship to study dairy engineering.

Having acquired specialized training at the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry and Dairying in Bangalore, Kurien went to the US and completed his masters in Mechanical Engineering with dairy engineering as a minor subject from the Michigan State University, in 1948.

A year later, he was assigned to a Government Creamery in Anand, Gujarat as part of his bond commitment.

Arriving in Anand on a hot May 13 in 1949, Kurien was a harried man, only waiting to be released from his bond and leave the place as quickly as possible.

He got his release orders after six months and was all set to pack up and go to the city of big bucks, Bombay (now, Mumbai) - but a minor incident halted him in his tracks.

Just as he was preparing his exit, Tribhuvandas Patel, the then chairman of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union, popularly known as 'Amul', with whom Kurien had developed a good friendship, requested him to stay back in Anand for some more time and help him organise his co-operative society's dairy equipment.

Kurien stayed back for a few more days...going on to become a legend through Operation Flood, launched in 1971.

""His forced tenure at Anand changed the destiny of the entire Indian dairy sector. He help the fledgling dairy co-operative movement and was forced to stay there to see it flourish. The rest is history,"" Sodhi said.

The Dairy co-operative movement had a modest beginning with the first Dairy Co-operative Union in Gujarat formed in 1942 with only two village co-operatives joining as members.

Around 65 years later that figure has grown to a staggering 16,100 with 3.20 million milk producers pouring millions of tonnes of milk into the GCMMF containers twice daily.

The NDDB, formed by Kurien's efforts, replicated the Amul Model all over India with remarkable results which dramatically increased the country's milk production.

Through Kurien's efforts vide the Amul Model, the country's milk production shot up from a mere 20 million metric tonnes (MMT) per annum in 1960 to a whopping 122 MMT last year.

The GCMMF's average daily milk production rose from 2.50 million kgs to 12.5 million kgs during the same period.

Kurien's main contribution was to design systems and institutions, which people could develop themselves, as he believed development of man can best be achieved by putting in his hands the instruments of development.

""He believed that the greatest assets of this country are its people, and dedicated his life to the task of harnessing the power of the people in a manner which promoted their larger interests,"" Sodhi explained.

He proved it by the Operation Flood in 1971 - creating a national milk grid - which was implemented in three phases.

Not only did it result in making India the world's largest producer of milk and milk products, it also helped reduce malpractices by milk producers and merchants, and alleviated poverty during that era.

The world took note of Kurien's efforts and showered honours on him, including India's Padma Vibhushan, the World Food Prize, Magsaysay Award, Carnegie-Wateler World Peace Prize, International Person of Year from US and other recognitions, for his work that touched millions of lives everyday in remote areas.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151158562249921/?type=3,2012-09-09 02:36:31,1289,125,488,1289,0,0,0,0,0
24967709920_10151156166519921,"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in a strongly-worded, written message to the nation, tore into the opposition today for a ""wasted session of Parliament"". 

Here's the full text of his message:

My fellow citizens,


We have just ended a wasted session of Parliament when both Houses were not allowed to function. The cause of the repeated disruption was that we had received a report of the CAG on the allocation of coal blocks which alleged some infirmities in the process. Instead of discussing this report in the PAC, which is the normal procedure, or even discussing it immediately in Parliament, which we offered to do, leaders of the opposition saw fit to demand my resignation before Parliament was even allowed to take a view on the report.

I feel very strongly that this is making a mockery of parliamentary democracy. We take pride in our parliamentary democracy and the tradition of free debate that it implies. Only a few months ago, during the 60th year celebrations of our Parliament, I said that the story of the Indian Parliament is a story of India striving for freedom and dignity; for tolerance and equality; for peace and progress.

We do not live up to these high ideals if we simply do not let Parliament function. The Government and the opposition both have a sacred  obligation to strengthen our parliamentary system.  We do incalculable damage to the reputation of India's Parliament if we resort to disruption of Parliament to make a political point.

Those who prevent Parliament from functioning, disable the voice of the people. They take away their right to hear their representatives debate issues in a reasoned manner when the case for and against a point of view can be heard. They force them to listen instead only to voices in the street, which is not the place for reasoned discourse.

This is the road to a dysfunctional politics which will only produce agitational politics and a deeply divided and disenchanted country.

I have high respect for the CAG as an institution. I believe we strengthen it only by taking its reports seriously enough to discuss them in the PAC and in the House. PAC reports deal with complex issues on which there can be different points of view and all these must be heard fully before rushing to judgement. We do not strengthen the CAG as an institution by using its reports to prevent discussion and cause disruption.

I assure all of you that the issues raised in the CAG report are not being swept under the carpet. They will be discussed in parliament as they should be. Whatever corrective action is necessary will be taken.

We are faced with many internal and external problems and challenges. There are problems of communal tension, ethnic violence and the ever present threat of naxalism.  Terrorism remains a serious threat. The nation should be concerned about what is happening in the Northeast. There are attempts to divide communities which led to thousands fleeing from some of our cities. We have to contain the forces of lawlessness.  These are some of the issues that should have been discussed in parliament so that our countrymen could have been better informed of these problems and ways of addressing them. 

On the economic front too we face major challenges. The world is passing through an exceptionally difficult phase. Our economy is also experiencing problems. We must work hard to ensure that the Indian economy returns to high growth. I have no doubt we can do it.

We can rebuild our growth momentum and encourage entrepreneurship by stimulating investment in infrastructure, in power, in roads, ports, railways, and telecommunications. This will send a clear signal to the world that India is on the road to recovery. This in turn will bring back the momentum of growth, generate productive employment and also enable us to direct more resources to help the poor and weaker sections.

We cannot do this if the government is constantly distracted by the actions of those who prefer obstruction over discussion.  Those who follow this path detract from India's prestige as the world's largest Parliamentary democracy. They are unwittingly only serving the ends of those who want to weaken the country and discredit its institutions.

Our job in Government, I have always maintained, is to grapple with the problems of mass poverty, ignorance and disease which still afflict millions of our citizens. We will not be distracted from this task.

We have had one wasted session. I hope Parliament can get back to business in the next session. Meanwhile the Government must act wherever it can without the benefit of Parliamentary guidance. I am instructing all Ministries to accelerarte their consideration of critical issues where decisions are needed to get the economy moving again.

I urge all right minded Indians to stand up and unite against the forces of anarchy and disruption to secure the foundations of our hard earned democratic and Constitutional rights.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151156166504921/?type=3,2012-09-07 13:23:30,1361,441,279,1361,0,0,0,0,0

Employing a child below 14 years in any kind of occupation will be completely banned and land you in jail with a maximum three years imprisonment or fine upto a maximum of Rs. 50,000 with the Union Cabinet today approving the measure.

Making employment of children below the age of 14 a cognisable offence, the Cabinet at its meeting cleared a proposal to amend the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 to put a total ban on employment of children below 14 years in any industry--hazardous or non-hazardous.

The amendment cleared at the meeting presided by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also approved a blanket ban on employing children below 18 years in hazardous industries like mining. At present children under the age of 14 years are prohibited from employment only in hazardous industry.

According to Census 2001, there were 12.6 million economically active children in the age-group of 5-14 years while the National Sample Survey data said the child workforce during 2004-05 was estimated at 9.07 million.
Labour and Employment Ministry officials said the amendments would ensure that all the children are compulsorily admitted in schools as per the mandate Right to Education Act, 2009 instead of being employed at workplaces.

It would also enable India to ratify ILO Convention 138 (minimum age for entry to employment) and Convention 182 (prohibition of employment of persons below 18 years in hazardous occupations).

The officials said maximum punishment for offences under the Act has been increased from one year imprisonment to two year imprisonment and from Rs 20,000 fine to Rs 50,000 fine or both.

For repeated offences, they added, the punishment has been raised to a three-year jail term.

Employment of persons below 18 years will be prohibited in hazardous occupations like in Mines, Explosives and hazardous occupations set forth in the Factories Act, 1948.

Prime Minister's statement in Parliament on the Performance Audit Report on Allocation of Coal Blocks and Augmentation of Coal Production 

1.      I seek the indulgence of the House to make a statement on issues regarding coal block allocations which have been the subject of much discussion in the press and on which several Hon'ble members have also expressed concern.

2.         The issues arise from a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which has been tabled in Parliament and remitted to the Public Accounts Committee.  CAG reports are normally discussed in detail in the Public Accounts Committee, when the Ministry concerned responds to the issues raised. The PAC then submits its report to the Speaker and that Report is then discussed in Parliament. 

3.         I seek your indulgence to depart from this established procedure because of the nature of the allegations that are being made and because I was holding the charge of Coal Minister for a part of the time covered by the report. I want to assure Hon'ble Members that as the Minister in charge, I take full responsibility for the decisions of the Ministry. I wish to say that any allegations of impropriety are without basis and unsupported by the facts. 

4.         Allocation of coal blocks to private companies for captive use commenced in 1993, after the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 was amended. This was done with the objective of attracting private investments in specified end uses. As the economy grew in size, the demand for coal also grew and it became evident that Coal India Ltd. alone would not be able to meet the growing demand. 

5.         Since 1993, allocation of captive coal blocks was being done on the basis of recommendations made by an inter-Ministerial Screening Committee which also had representatives of State governments. Taking into account the increasing number of applicants for coal block allocation, the Government, in 2003, evolved a consolidated set of guidelines to ensure transparency and consistency in allocation. 

6.         In the wake of rapidly growing demand for coal and captive coal blocks, it was the UPA I Government which, for the first time, conceived the idea of making allocations through the competitive bidding route in June 2004.

7.         The CAG report is critical of the allocations mainly on three counts. Firstly, it states that the Screening Committee did not follow a transparent and objective method while making recommendations for allocation of coal blocks. 

8.         Secondly, it observes that competitive bidding could have been introduced in 2006 by amending the administrative instructions in vogue instead of going through a prolonged legal examination of the issue which delayed the decision making process. 

9.         Finally, the report mentions that the delay in introduction of competitive bidding rendered the existing process beneficial to a large number of private companies. According to the assumptions and computations made by the CAG, there is a financial gain of about Rs. 1.86 lakh crore to private parties.

10.       The observations of the CAG are clearly disputable. 

11.       The policy of allocation of coal blocks to private parties, which the CAG has criticised, was not a new policy introduced by the UPA. The policy has existed since 1993 and previous Governments also allocated coal blocks in precisely the manner that the CAG has now criticised.

12.       The UPA made improvements in the procedure in 2005 by inviting applications through open advertisements after providing details of the coal blocks on offer along with the guidelines and the conditions of allotment. These applications were examined and evaluated by a broad based Steering Committee with representatives from state governments, related ministries of the central government and the coal companies. The applications were assessed on parameters such as the techno economic feasibility of the end use project, status of preparedness to set up the end use project, past track record in execution of projects, financial and technical capabilities of the applicant companies, recommendations of the state governments and the administrative ministry concerned.

13.       Any administrative allocation procedure involves some judgment and in this case the judgment was that of the many participants in the Screening Committee acting collectively. There were then no allegations of impropriety in the functioning of the Committee.

14.       The CAG says that competitive bidding could have been introduced in 2006 by amending the existing administrative instructions. This premise of the CAG is flawed. 

15.       The observation of the CAG that the process of competitive bidding could have been introduced by amending the administrative instructions is based on the opinion expressed by the Department of Legal Affairs in July and August 2006. However, the CAG's observation is based on a selective reading of the opinions given by the Department of Legal Affairs. 

16.       Initially, the Government had initiated a proposal to introduce competitive bidding by formulating appropriate rules. This matter was referred to the Department of Legal Affairs, which initially opined that amendment to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act would be necessary for this purpose. 

17.       A meeting was convened in the PMO on 25 July 2005 which was attended by representatives of coal and lignite bearing states. In the meeting the representatives of state governments were opposed to the proposed switch over to competitive bidding. It was further noted that the legislative changes that would be required for the proposed change would require considerable time and the process of allocation of coal blocks for captive mining could not be kept in abeyance for so long given the pressing demand for coal.  Therefore, it was decided in this meeting to continue with the allocation of coal blocks through the extant Screening Committee procedure till the new competitive bidding procedure became operational. This was a collective decision of the centre and the state governments concerned.

18.       It was only in August 2006 that the Department of Legal Affairs opined that competitive bidding could be introduced through administrative instructions. However, the same Department also opined that legislative amendments would be required for placing the proposed process on a sound legal footing. In a meeting held in September, 2006, Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs categorically opined that having regard to the nature and scope of the relevant legislation, it would be most appropriate to achieve the objective through amendment to the Mines & Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act. 

19.       In any case, in a democracy, it is difficult to accept the notion that a decision of the Government to seek legislative amendment to implement a change in policy should come for adverse audit scrutiny. The issue was contentious and the proposed change to competitive bidding required consensus building among various stakeholders with divergent views, which is inherent in the legislative process. 

20.       As stated above, major coal and lignite bearing states like West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Rajasthan that were ruled by opposition parties, were strongly opposed to a switch over to the process of competitive bidding as they felt that it would increase the cost of coal, adversely impact value addition and development of industries in their areas and would dilute their prerogative in the selection of lessees. 

21.       The then Chief Minister of Rajasthan Smt. Vasundhara Raje wrote to me in April 2005 opposing competitive bidding saying that it was against the spirit of the Sarkaria Commission recommendations. Dr. Raman Singh, Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh wrote to me in June 2005 seeking continuation of the extant policy and requesting that any changes in coal policy be made after arriving at a consensus between the Central Government and the States. The State Governments of West Bengal and Orissa also wrote formally opposing a change to the system of competitive bidding.   

22.       Ministry of Power, too, felt that auctioning of coal could lead to enhanced cost of producing energy. 

23.       It is pertinent to mention that the Coal Mines Nationalisation (Amendment) Bill, 2000 to facilitate commercial mining by private companies was pending in the Parliament for a long time owing to stiff opposition from the stakeholders. 

24.       Despite the elaborate consultative process undertaken prior to introducing the amendment Bill in Parliament, the Standing Committee advised the Ministry of Coal to carry out another round of discussions with the States. This further demonstrates that the decision to seek broader consultation and consensus through a Parliamentary process was the right one. 

25.       The CAG report has criticised the Government for not implementing this decision speedily enough. In retrospect, I would readily agree that in a world where things can be done by fiat, we could have done it faster. But, given the complexities of the process of consensus building in our Parliamentary system, this is easier said than done. 

26.       Let me humbly submit that, even if we accept CAG's contention that benefits accrued to private companies, their computations can be questioned on a number of technical points. The CAG has computed financial gains to private parties as being the difference between the average sale price and the production cost of CIL of the estimated extractable reserves of the allocated coal blocks. Firstly, computation of extractable reserves based on averages would not be correct. Secondly, the cost of production of coal varies significantly from mine to mine even for CIL due to varying geo-mining conditions, method of extraction, surface features, number of settlements, availability of infrastructure etc. Thirdly, CIL has been generally mining coal in areas with better infrastructure and more favourable mining conditions, whereas the coal blocks offered for captive mining are generally located in areas with more difficult geological conditions. Fourthly, a part of the gains would in any case get appropriated by the government through taxation and under the MMDR Bill, presently being considered by the parliament, 26% of the profits earned on coal mining operations would have to be made available for local area development. Therefore, aggregating the purported financial gains to private parties merely on the basis of the average production costs and sale price of CIL could be highly misleading. Moreover, as the coal blocks were allocated to private companies only for captive purposes for specified end-uses, it would not be appropriate to link the allocated blocks to the price of coal set by CIL.

27.       There are other important technical issues which will be gone into thoroughly in the Ministry of Coal's detailed response to the PAC and I do not propose to focus on them.

28.       It is true that the private parties that were allocated captive coal blocks could not achieve their production targets. This could be partly due to cumbersome processes involved in getting statutory clearances, an issue we are addressing separately. We have initiated action to cancel the allocations of allottees who did not take adequate follow-up action to commence production. Moreover, CBI is separately investigating the allegations of malpractices, on the basis of which due action will be taken against wrongdoers, if any. 

Hon'ble members, 

29.       From 1993 onwards, successive governments continued with the policy of allocation of coal blocks for captive use and did not treat such allocations as a revenue generating activity. Let me reiterate that the idea of introducing auction was conceived for the first time by the UPA Government in the wake of increasing demand for captive blocks. Action was initiated to examine the idea in all its dimensions and the process culminated in Parliament approving the necessary legislative amendments in 2010. The law making process inevitably took time on account of several factors that I have outlined. 

30.       While the process of making legislative changes was in progress, the only alternative before the Government was to continue with the current system of allocations through the Screening Committee mechanism till the new system of auction based competitive bidding could be put in place. Stopping the process of allocation would only have delayed the much needed expansion in the supply of coal. Although the coal produced thus far from the blocks allocated to the private sector is below the target, it is reasonable to expect that as clearances are speeded up, production will come into effect in the course of the Twelfth Plan. Postponing the allocation of coal blocks until the new system was in place would have meant lower energy production, lower GDP growth and also lower revenues. It is unfortunate that the CAG has not taken these aspects into account. 

31.       Let me state emphatically that it has always been the intention of Government to augment production of coal by making available coal blocks for captive mining through transparent processes and guidelines which fully took into account the legitimate concerns of all stakeholders, including the State Governments. The implicit suggestion of the CAG that the Government should have circumvented the legislative process through administrative instructions, over the registered objections of several state governments including those ruled by opposition parties, if implemented would have been undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the functioning of our federal polity. The facts speak for themselves and show that the CAG's findings are flawed on multiple counts. 

32.       This, in short, is the background, the factual position and the rationale of government's actions. Now that the report of the CAG is before the House, appropriate action on the recommendations and observations contained in the report will follow through the established parliamentary procedures.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151137515209921/?type=3,2012-08-27 02:17:45,1165,303,380,1165,0,0,0,0,0

My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children, 

I greet you all on this anniversary of our Independence. 

""The leaders of our freedom movement, under the stewardship of Mahatma Gandhi, had dreamt of an independent and prosperous India. On this day in 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took the first step towards the realization of that dream by hoisting the Tricolour at the Red Fort. The journey we began on 15 August, 1947 is now 65 years old. We have achieved much in these 65 years. 

Today is certainly a day to celebrate the success of our democracy. However, on this occasion we should also introspect about what remains to be done. We would achieve independence in the true sense only when we are able to banish poverty, illiteracy, hunger and backwardness from our country. This would be possible only when we learn from our failures and build on our successes. 

You are aware that these days the global economy is passing through a difficult phase. The pace of economic growth has come down in all countries of the world. Seen together, the European countries are estimated to grow at 0 percent this year. Our country has also been affected by these adverse external conditions. Also, there have been domestic developments which are hindering our economic growth. Last year our GDP grew by 6.5 percent. This year we hope to do a little better. 

We cannot do much about the conditions that prevail outside our country. But we must make every effort to resolve the problems inside our country so that our economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities in the country are again speeded up. 

While doing this, we must also control inflation. This would pose some difficulty because of a bad monsoon this year. However, we have taken many measures to deal with the situation. In districts where there has been a deficit of 50 percent or more in the rainfall, diesel subsidy is being provided to farmers by the Government. Seed subsidy has been enhanced. Funds available under the Central scheme for fodder have been increased. Our effort is to ensure that people do not face difficulty due to shortage of seeds, fodder or water in any part of the country. It is good that we have a big stock of foodgrains because of the hard work of our farmer brothers and sisters, and availability of foodgrains is not a problem for us. 

As far as creating an environment within the country for rapid economic growth is concerned, I believe that we are not being able to achieve this because of a lack of political consensus on many issues. Time has now come to view the issues which affect our development processes as matters of national security. 

If we do not increase the pace of the country's economic growth, take steps to encourage new investment in the economy, improve the management of Government finances and work for the livelihood security of the common man and energy security of the country, then it most certainly affects our national security. 

I promise to you today that our Government will work hard for India's rapid economic growth and for shielding the country from the effects of the global economic slowdown. I promise that we will work hard for creation of new employment opportunities for our young men and women living in villages and cities. We will make every possible effort to secure the livelihood of our poor brothers and sister, our workers and our farmers. We will leave no stone unturned to encourage investment in our country so that our entrepreneurs can make a substantial contribution to our economy. 

I believe that this period of difficulties will not last long. Even as we face these problems, we should be encouraged by the fact that we have achieved extraordinary successes in many areas in the last 8 years. We now need to replicate these successes in newer areas. 

It has been our endeavour in the last 8 years to empower our citizens socially and economically so that they can contribute to the sacred task of nation building. Today, one out of every 5 households in the country has become eligible to benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Act through a job card. In only the last one year we have provided employment to more than 8 crore people under this scheme. 

When the UPA Government came to power in 2004, we had promised that we would provide electricity to all villages. To fulfill this promise, we launched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme. More than 1 lakh new villages have been provided with electricity connections under this scheme and now almost all the villages in the country have been electrified. Our next target is to provide electricity to each and every household in our country in the next 5 years and to also improve the supply of electricity. 

No praise is high enough for our hard working farmers. They have produced a record output of crops successively in the last 2 years. Because of our Government's efforts for development of agriculture and for protecting the interests of farmers, agriculture has grown at an average rate of 3.3 per cent in the 11th Plan which is substantially higher than the 2.4 per cent we achieved in the 10th Plan. In the last 8 years, we have doubled the support prices of crops. We are providing loans at low interest rates to lakhs of farmers. 

Our children are the biggest strength of our country. If our children are provided with good education and are healthy, then our future would be bright. 

This is the reason why we have paid special attention to the needs of children in our policies and programmes. The education of children has been made mandatory by law. In the year 2006-07, only 93 per cent of children in the age group 6-14 years were getting admission in schools. Today almost all children in this age group are being admitted to schools. More than 51,000 new schools have been opened in the country and about 7 lakh teachers appointed in them in just the last 2 years. Now we will focus on improving the quality of education. In the next few months we will put in place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are getting from teaching. Participation of the community and parents would be ensured so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching. 

The Mid-day-meal Scheme provides nutritious meals in schools for about 12 crore children everyday. This is the biggest scheme of its kind in the world. 

In the last one and half years no new case of polio has come to light and now India does not figure in the list of countries affected by this disease. 

Malnutrition in children is a big challenge for us. We have taken steps in many dimensions to deal with this problem. In the last 8 years, the number of mothers and children benefitting from the ICDS has doubled. The process of making the ICDS more effective is in its last stages and will be completed in the next 1 or 2 months. 

We had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005 so that health services can be extended to each village in the country. Today this Mission is being implemented with the help of 10 lakh health personnel including 8.5 lakh Asha workers. After the success of the National Rural health Mission, we now want to expand the scope of health services in our towns also. The National Rural Health Mission will be converted into a National Health Mission which would cover all villages and towns in the country. We are also formulating a scheme for distribution of free medicines through Government hospitals and health centres. 

We want to create many new job opportunities for our youth in the coming years. To achieve this it is necessary that we train them in skills which our economy needs. It is our endeavour to put in place a system in which training facilities are available in many new skills. We also wish to provide short duration training courses of 6 weeks to 6 months for our young brothers and sisters. The National Skill Development Council has formulated a major scheme for skill development in which 8 crore people will be trained in the next 5 years. This is an ambitious scheme which can be implemented only through a specialized agency of the Central Government. Therefore, we are considering the establishment of a National Skill Development Authority so that skill development programmes all over the country can be implemented in a coordinated manner. We would also need contribution from the private sector and non-Governmental organizations in this work. 

Creation of new employment opportunities is possible only when we encourage industry and trade. For this we need to speedily improve our infrastructure. Recently we have taken new measures to accelerate infrastructure development. Ambitious targets have been fixed in roads, airports, railways, electricity generation and coal production. The Government will take steps to increase investment for infrastructure development with the help of the private sector. To attract foreign capital, we will have to create confidence at the international level that there are no barriers to investment in India. 

Just 10 years back only 3 out of every 10 households in our villages were benefitting from banking services. Today more than half of the rural households get the benefit of bank accounts. It will be our endeavour to ensure that all households benefit from bank accounts in the next 2 years. 

We want to create a system in which money from Government schemes - pension for old people, scholarship for students and wages for labourers - can be credited directly into people's bank accounts. This would reduce inconvenience to the beneficiaries, make it easy for them to receive payment and increase transparency. For this work, we will take help from the Aadhar scheme under which about 20 crore people have been registered so far. 

To provide housing for our poor brothers and sisters residing in urban areas of our country we will soon launch the Rajiv Housing Loan Scheme. Under this scheme, people belonging to the economically weaker sections would be given relief on interest for housing loans of less than Rs. 5 lakh. 

This year we will present the Twelfth Five Year Plan for consideration of the National Development Council. The Plan would determine the future course of action on all important matters relating to the country's development. It would lay down measures for increasing our present rate of economic growth from 6.5 to 9 per cent in the last year of the Plan. The Plan would focus special attention on areas important from the point of view of reaching the fruits of development to each citizen of our country and specially to the weaker sections of our society. I have full confidence that the Centre and the States will act together to implement the Twelfth Plan in an effective manner. 

The incidents of violence which occurred in Assam recently are very unfortunate. I know that these incidents have resulted in the disruption of the lives of a large number of people. We fully sympathize with those families which have been affected by the violence. We are doing everything possible to provide relief to them. I also promise to you that our Government will make every effort to understand the reasons behind the violence and work hard with the State Governments to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in any part of the country. 

We have achieved success in many areas of internal security. In Jammu and Kashmir, people participated in large numbers in the Panchayat elections. There has been a reduction in violence in the North Eastern States and we are engaged in dialogue with many groups there so that they can join the mainstream of development. We have initiated new schemes of development in areas affected by naxal violence to ensure that the grievances of the people residing there, especially our brothers and sisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes, can be removed and their lot can be improved. However, we need to be constantly vigilant as far as internal security is concerned. Communal harmony has to be maintained at all costs. Naxalism is still a serious problem. The incidents which occurred in Pune in the beginning of this month point to the need for much more work to be done in the area of national security. We will continue to do this work with sincerity in the future also. 

I would like to congratulate our scientists and technologists who have enhanced our prestige by successfully testing the Agni V Missile and launching the RISAT- I Satellite in space this year. Recently the Cabinet has approved the Mars Orbiter Mission. Under this Mission, our spaceship will go near Mars and collect important scientific information. This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology. 

We have seen a lot of discussion in the recent months about the role of our armed forces and their preparedness. I would like to emphasise here that our armed forces and paramilitary forces have defended the security of our country both during war and peace with valour and honour. Our soldiers have made the biggest of sacrifices, whenever needed. Today I would like to reassure our countrymen that our armed forces and paramilitary forces are prepared to face any challenge. The Government will continue to work for modernizing these forces and providing them with the necessary technology and equipment. Today, I would like to thank our security forces, who are guarding our frontiers bravely, from the bottom of my heart. We will continue to make efforts for their welfare. 

Our Government has set up a committee to examine issues relating to pay and pension of armed forces personnel. This committee will also look into matters concerning pension of retired men and officers and family pension being paid to their families. We will take prompt action on the recommendations of the committee, once they are received. 

Our Government has paid special attention to the welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and other weaker sections. The special needs of our tribal and backward districts are being met through programmes such as the Integrated Action Plan, Backward Regions Grant Fund and Tribal Sub Plan. Through the Forest Rights Act, we have given proprietary rights to lakhs of our brothers and sisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes on land on which they have been living for generations. We are formulating a scheme to ensure that people belonging to Scheduled Tribes can get fair and remunerative prices for the forest produce they collect. The Government wants to speedily convert the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill into a legislation. Through this law we want to provide funds for the benefit of our tribal brothers and sisters in the mining areas. 

We will make the 15 points programme for minorities more effective. The Multi-Sectoral Development Programme being implemented in districts with large minority populations will be expanded. 

We have enhanced the amount of post-matric scholarship available to children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and minorities. Our efforts to make these scholarship schemes more effective will continue.We are considering a new and effective law to put an end to the repulsive practice of manual scavenging and to provide opportunities to those engaged in this practice to begin their lives afresh. 

Our commitment to make the work of the Government and administration transparent and accountable stands. On the last Independence Day, I promised you that we would take many steps for this purpose. I am happy to state that during the last 1 year we have achieved good progress in this area. The Lok Sabha has cleared the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill. We hope that all political parties will help us in passing this Bill in the Rajya Sabha. A number of other Bills have also been presented before the Parliament. The Cabinet has cleared a Public Procurement Bill. We will continue our efforts to bring more transparency and accountability in the work of public servants and to reduce corruption. But we will also take care that these measures do not result in a situation in which the morale of public functionaries taking decisions in public interest gets affected because of baseless allegations and unnecessary litigation. 

In my first message to the country after assuming the office of Prime Minister I had appealed to you to contribute to the sacred work of nation building. I am very happy that today more of our citizens than ever before, and specially the youth, are taking interest in issues related to the progress of our society and country. Our Government believes that the difficult problems which India faces can be resolved only with the cooperation of the common man. It will be our endeavour that in the coming time, still more people help us in tasks like removal of poverty, illiteracy and inequality. 

I believe that no power in the world can stop our country from achieving new heights of progress and development. What is needed is that we work together as one people for the success of our country. Let us once more resolve that we will continue to work for a progressive, modern and prosperous India.""

Exhorting the party's state youth wing to rally the people behind the Congress, Gandhi said the party's state unit leaders and cadres should also brace up to dislodge the BJP government in the next assembly elections, due in early 2013.
""You should remain united and work hard to ensure that the people throw out the corrupt BJP government and bring our party back to power in the state. It is important to bury differences, if any, and brace up for the state elections next year,"" Gandhi asserted.
Lamenting that the state government failed to properly utilise funds that the central government had released for implementing social schemes, Gandhi said as a result the ruling BJP's leaders and ministers became richer, while the people remained backward.
""The Congress is the only party that can change the fortunes of Karnataka. But to enable it, our experienced leaders and young members should work in unison and give the people an opportunity to vote the party back to power,"" Gandhi said in Hindi.
Accusing the BJP government of dividing people on caste lines and discriminating against some communities, Gandhi said that in contrast the previous governments were pro-people and strived for the welfare of farmers, weaker sections, minorities and the less privileged.
""Unlike in the past when the whole state used to move in unison for the welfare and socio-economic development of its people, the BJP government has been dividing people to make them fight against each other,"" Gandhi observed.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10150946372539921/?type=3,2012-06-02 15:56:06,668,262,95,668,0,0,0,0,0

Prime Minister's Speech on Civil Services Day, 2012

Please Read and Spread

On this occasion of the seventh Civil Services Day I warmly greet all members of our civil services. This annual event provides our civil services an opportunity to reaffirm their collective commitment to serve our country and our people to the best of their ability. It is also an occasion for the civil servants to introspect and reflect on their role and performance, and how these can be made more effective, more meaningful.

I have seen the three themes for today's deliberations. They all cover issues that are important for the country and of immediate relevance to the functioning of our civil servants. I am sure that you will have productive discussions during the course of the day. But I also believe that the significance of today's event lies equally in sending out a message that we are all determined to make our civil services more competent, more professional, and alive to the requirements of the twenty first century and capable of facilitating rapid social and economic progress in our country. 

I have always believed that there is no dearth of talent in our civil services. Many of our civil servants would rank among the best in the world. They have done excellent work. They have delivered results in the face of adversity. Several civil servants have been shining examples of probity and integrity, working selflessly for the public good. Indeed, we have just been introduced to the work of some outstanding civil servants. I congratulate today's award winners and wish them even more success in the future.

As I said earlier, the Civil Services Day should also be an occasion for introspection. Even as we celebrate our successes, we should also be honest in admitting our failures and our deficiencies. I would like to take today's opportunity to flag some issues about the civil services which I believe agitate the public mind. 

There is a growing perception, right or wrong, that the moral fiber of our civil servants and public servants in general, is not as strong as it used to be some decades back and that our civil servants are now more likely to succumb to extraneous pressures in their work. These perceptions might be exaggerated but I do think that there is a grain of truth in them. 

The decisions that the civil servants take must be fair and objective in nature, based on sound evidence and deep analysis and designed to serve the best interests of our country. Their judgment and advice should not be affected by the nature and color of the political leadership. If this does not happen, the impartiality and fairness of the decision making processes in public administration would get compromised and the quality of our output would be sub-optimal. I think, therefore, this is a vigil that the civil servants must maintain constantly. I also believe that there is a growing perception in the public that over the years the attributes of objectivity in work has been diluted. I leave it to the civil servants to ponder to what extent this perception is true and what they can collectively do to remove it from the public mind. 

This brings me to yet another issue that I would like to flag today. We live in times of great change. Our society and our economy are undergoing rapid transformation. Every day we are exposed to new technology and to new ways of doing things. Not only this, technology has made the world smaller and best practices now get disseminated much faster than ever before. We should therefore ask ourselves the question whether, in our ways of doing things, we are keeping pace with the changes taking place all around us. I think it is generally felt that the civil services have somewhat lagged behind in this area. I am aware that it is not very easy to change systems, procedures and processes in the public sector. But this should be taken as a challenge and our civil servants should redouble their efforts to adopt more modern methods and practices. 

In my last Civil Services Day address on April 21, 2011 I had outlined the measures that our government had taken or was contemplating to tackle the menace of corruption in public life. I believe that since then we have made substantial progress towards strengthening the legislative framework and revamping our administrative practices to enable us to fight corruption better. Even as our government moves forward in these efforts, which I don't want to list in detail today, it should be our endeavor that there is no witch hunting in the name of fighting corruption. It is our government's commitment to put in place a system and create an environment in which our civil servants are encouraged to be decisive, and no one is harassed for bonafide mistakes of errors of judgment. We stand committed to protecting honest and well meaning civil servants who might have made genuine errors in their work. And I sincerely hope that these intentions of our government are shared by the state governments too. 

On their part, the civil servants in our country should fight the tendency of not taking decisions because of the fear that things might go wrong and they might be penalised for that. We cannot have a bureaucracy which is hundred percent risk averse. In fact we should encourage boldness in decision making, provided that the decisions are well considered and as per the law of the land. A civil servant who does not take decisions might always be safe, but at the end of the day he or she would have contributed nothing to our society and to our country. 

Let me also very briefly comment on the topics that will be deliberated upon today. The first theme ""Security for the Marginalized: Vision for a Caring India"" particularly relevant to all of us in the context of our commitment and efforts towards inclusion towards the integration of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities in the national mainstream. As we enter the Twelfth Plan period we should redouble our efforts for building a society and country in which the fruits of development are shared by each and every citizen. Our growth would not have much meaning if we fail in building a truly inclusive society and country. Indeed, without inclusion, social and economic, the very sustainability of our growth processes comes under question. The other two themes relate to making our civil services corruption free and more transparent and accountable, and also to enable them to improve service delivery to our citizens. These issues are of abiding relevance to all of us. I once again wish you very productive discussions on all these issues. 

Let me end by stating that we have full faith in our civil services. They have served our country well. Our civil servants have made a very substantial contribution to our country's progress. I congratulate them for their achievements. I wish them all the best for the future.

24967709920_10150762562224921,"Agni-V, India's first ICBM test-fired successfully


India on Thursday conducted the maiden test of its indigenously developed nuclear capable Agni V ballistic missile with a strike range of over 5,000 km, from the Wheeler Island off Odisha coast.

The three-stage solid propellant missile was test-fired from a mobile launcher from the launch complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at about 8.05 a.m., defence sources said.

Soon after the maiden launch took place, Agni V witnessed a smooth and perfect vertical lift-off from the launcher and analysis was done to assess its health parameters after retrieval of date from all the sophisticated wide range of communication network systems, they said.

The test-fire of the first of its kind missile, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday, had to be postponed at the last moment due to bad weather marked by rains and heavy lightning, the sources said.

The trial of Agni V, considered to be of the category of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), demonstrates giant strides taken by India in its integrated missile development programme. Only the United States, Russia, France and China possess the capability to operate an ICBM at present.

""The sleek missile, within a few seconds of its blast-off from the Island launch pad roared majestically into the sky leaving behind its trajectory, a trail of thin orange and white smoke before disappearing,"" said an eyewitness to the launch, conducted amid light drizzle.

The surface-to-surface Agni V is capable of striking a target more than 5,000 km away. It is about 17 metre long and two metre wide with launch weight of around 50 tonnes. The sophisticated missile can carry a nuclear warhead of more than one tonne.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10150762562224921/?type=3,2012-04-18 23:01:10,984,150,149,984,0,0,0,0,0

The need for revamping the river conservation programme was widely recognised in view of the shortcomings in the approach followed in GAP. It was felt necessary that a new holistic approach based on river basin as the unit of planning and institutional redesign may be adopted.

 After the Supreme Court this week upheld the constitutional validity of Right to Education Act, the government on Sunday allayed fears and dismissed suggestions that the burden which private schools will have to bear to implement the law will be passed on to students.

The RTE Act mandates schools to provide free education to 25% of students from economically weaker sections between 6 to 14 years of age.

""I do not think that will happen,"" Sibal said in a TV interview, adding, ""I think there would be ways and means to raise resources.""

Sibal also assured that government will take care to ensure education to students coming from the margins of society after Class VIII when the provision of the Act comes to an end.

Asked who will pay the tab for the 25% reservation, he said under the RTE Act, schools which have not taken any benefit from the government will be compensated by the government. ""We have made the calculation,"" Sibal said.

However, he agreed that this was not sufficient and said that during the 12th five year plan, the government will provide school uniform and textbooks to students. Sibal also said that the schools can raise resources from their funds if they have surplus resources and they can also tap the funds provided by corporates through their corporate social responsibility obligation.

""You have many corporates who are committed for corporate social responsibilities. Schools can actually tap their resources so that there is no burden on parents,"" Sibal added.

24967709920_10150739301589921,"India Water Week-2012

PM's address at the inaugural ceremony of India Water Week

I am very happy to have this opportunity to inaugurate the India Water Week that is focussing this year on the important themes of water, food and energy security.

With around 17% of the world's population but only 4% of its usable fresh water, India has a scarcity of water. Rapid economic growth and urbanisation are widening the demand supply gap. Climate change could further aggravate the availability of water in the country as it threatens the water cycle. Our water bodies are getting increasingly polluted by untreated industrial effluents and sewage. Groundwater levels are falling in many parts due to excess drawals leading to contamination with fluoride, arsenic and other chemicals. The practice of open defecation, which regrettably is all too widespread, contributes to contaminating potable water sources.

The Planning Commission has identified the challenge of managing our water resources in a rational and sustainable manner as one of the critical challenges in the Twelfth Five year Plan. It will require action on many fronts and coordination across different sectors of our economy.

We have launched a National Water Mission as part of our Action Plan on Climate Change. The main objective of this Mission is to achieve integrated management of water resources by conserving water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within various States of our Union.

The Mission proposed a review of the National Water Policy and a draft of the new Policy has been put in the public domain for widespread public consultation.

The draft National Water Policy recommends taking the river basin / sub-basin as a unit for planning and management of water resources and proposes that departments / organizations at the Centre and the States be restructured and be made multi-disciplinary. It also proposes the establishment of water regulatory authorities in each State and a national forum to deliberate upon issues relating to water and evolve consensus, cooperation and reconciliation amongst the various States.

One of the problems in achieving better management is that the current institutional and legal structures that deal with water in our country are inadequate, fragmented and need urgent reform. The planning, development and management of water resources has to keep pace with current realities.

There is a suggestion that a broad over-arching national legal framework of general principles on water is necessary to pave the way for essential legislation on water governance in every State.

We need to reflect on these and other proposals that will help to connect the institutional dots essential to implement an integrated and coherent water policy.

Given the limitations on increasing supply, a large part of any effort to close the demand supply gap must focus on increasing water use efficiency. The National Water Mission sets a target of 20% improvement in water use efficiency. This is particularly critical in the agricultural sector, which uses about three fourth of our water resources and where the water use efficiency is low compared to international standards.

Management of our irrigation systems should move away from a narrow engineering-construction-centric approach to a more multi-disciplinary and participatory approach. Incentives needs to be built in to narrow the gap between irrigation capacities created and those being utilized. We need to focus on command area development in a holistic manner in our irrigation projects. We need to move towards transparent and participatory mechanisms of pricing of water by the primary stakeholders themselves.

On the supply side we have been working on watershed management, rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge. Over the next five years, we need to give renewed vigour to all schemes that involve water. We need to address issues that come in the way of convergence and integration of programmes like National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the Integrated Watershed Management Programme, the Programme on Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies and the Rainfed Area Development Programme.

Conserving our groundwater is now an urgent priority because we depend on it for more than two thirds of our water needs. The decline in the water table across the country is a matter of serious concern. The present legal situation gives every land holder the right to pump unlimited quantities of water from a bore well on his own ground. There is no regulation of ground water extraction and no coordination among competing uses. Inadequate and sub-optimal pricing of both power and water is promoting the misuse of groundwater. We need to move to a situation where ground-water can be treated as a common property resource.

As a first step towards effective management of water resources we need to map the aquifers of India to obtain basic information on ground water availability. This will be initiated in the Twelfth Plan. We also need to promote participatory management of aquifers to ensure sustainable and equitable use and promoting cropping patterns which are aligned with the groundwater actually available. We should also examine seriously the proposal to have a clear legal framework to govern the use of scarce groundwater resources.

Access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation are basic human needs. They are fundamentally linked to the health and wellbeing of our people. Groundwater sources of drinking water often fail due to competition over the same aquifer between public drinking water systems and private irrigation. In the absence of sound legal framework, drinking water systems often lose the contest. Our struggle against open defecation and lack of sanitation and hygiene is often frustrated by lack of water. Our policies should therefore factor in the urgent priority we must necessarily give to meeting these critical water needs.

I believe that there is much to benefit from cooperation, particularly among the developing countries, in dealing with the challenges of water, food and energy security.

The sun, for example, is an asset of the developing world and yet solar technologies remain underdeveloped. Each of our societies has rich traditions of living in harmony with nature, conserving its bounty and communally managing common resources.

Our forefathers built magnificent water harvesting structures that were technologically diverse and built on sound engineering principles. These were built for local conditions and each water system was managed through local participation and community control. We need to call upon this ingenuity that existed among us and collaborate in finding cooperative solutions that help us to recycle, reuse and recharge. The World Water Week is an excellent platform to do so and I wish the deliberations all success.

Ghaziabad : On the day of the fifth round of polling for a new Uttar Pradesh assembly, Congress star Rahul Gandhi Thursday told thousands not to trust Chief Minister Mayawati or Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, saying neither was worthy of their votes.

The Congress general secretary went hammer and tongs against Mayawati, Mulayam Yadav and also the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), holdign them responsible for the lack of Uttar Pradesh's development since 1989, the year the state slipped out of Congress hands.

Repeating allegations he has made countless times, Gandhi said at two election rallies that the only way forward for Uttar Pradesh was to have a government of the Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).

""They come in choppers, fly out in choppers, get the votes and then forget the voters for five years,"" Gandhi said of the other parties.

""They have become addicted to fooling voters because they have succeeded in fooling them every five years.""

He accused Mayawati of siphoning several thousand crore of rupees sent by the central government.

""The entire efforts of the central government to assist rural Uttar Pradesh has proved futile because Mayawati's elephants (her party symbol) had exhausted the entire funds.""

Gandhi accused Mulayam Yadav of doling out false assurances to farmers.

He went on to bring out visible differences between Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Delhi, and asked the crowds if they could make differences in governance.

When the crowds roared in approval, he said the credit for a better Delhi went to the Congress.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10150641028349921/?type=3,2012-02-23 12:33:35,796,346,77,796,0,0,0,0,0

Striking an upbeat note about the prospects of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls next year, party leader Rahul Gandhi has pitched for younger leadership in the organisation at various levels and stressed that the absence of leaders in the 40-50 age group was a ""big handicap"".
In an interaction with partymen, Gandhi is understood to have conveyed that the Congress need not be diffident as its flagship programmes had created a groundswell of goodwill and the opposition had ""no answer"" for that.
After former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, there was a gap from 1991 to 1998 to bring up new leaders - which was affecting the Congress now, the Congress general secretary told party men.

Gandhi, who has been extensively touring poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to revive electoral fortunes of his party, is understood to have stressed that the response the Congress was getting now in the state was proof that its basic vote share was intact.

A great Report by Nandan Nilekani Chairman, Unique Identification Authority of India.

http://finmin.nic.in/reports/Interim_report_Task_Force_DTS.pdf


One of the priorities that have emerged in recent years is the need to strengthen India's social safety net and improve the delivery mechanisms of poverty alleviation programs. This is to ensure that vulnerable groups can withstand unforeseen shocks to income and continue to access basic goods and services at affordable prices. The 2011-12 Budget has accordingly planned for increases in expenditure to meet these goals, and also recommended direct subsidy transfers to improve the efficiency and reach of welf. 
The proposed framework for direct transfer of subsidies is as follows:

i) A subsidy, by its very nature, introduces two or more prices for the same good, and creates
incentives for pilferage and diversion. As a result, the underprivileged suffer the most. Ensuring
that goods move in the supply chain at market prices can minimize the incentives for diversion.

ii) Where possible, it is best to empower beneficiaries and give them the choice to receive
subsidies in the form of subsidized goods and services or as cash, based on their own
preferences. Further, beneficiaries should also be offered choice to exercise their preference at
any participating location, rather than restricting the service delivery point to a specific
location.

iii) Creation of a Core Subsidy Management System (CSMS) for the purpose of maintaining bookkeeping information on entitlements and subsidies for all beneficiaries. The CSMS will also provide increased transparency in the govement of goods, levels of stocks, prediction and aggregation of demand, and identification of beneficiaries. It will be able to use analytics to detect fraud and diversion. It can also integrate with a contact centre for grievance handling.
Beneficiaries can report malpractices to the Government directly making it possible for the Government to react in a timely manner.

iv) Just as a real-time transfer of funds takes place when people top up their mobile talk time, the Government, through the CSMS will transfer the cash component of subsidies directly and in real-time to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. Beneficiaries may then access these funds through various banking channels such as bank branches, ATMs, business correspondents, internet, and mobile banking. Achieving full financial inclusion is crucial for direct transfer of
subsidies.

v) As the subsidy management systems assume same configuration under CSMS, integration of all
subsidies, entitlements under one umbrella is also achievable are benefits for the underprivileged.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10150404329284921/?type=3,2011-11-11 05:20:02,358,104,57,358,0,0,0,0,0

24967709920_10151091246674921,"Rahul on Nuclear Deal : Lok Sabha 

This morning I spoke about two poor families. One of them was called ""Mrs. Kala,"" and Mrs. Kala said that she had diversified her income sources, and she has used that to stabilize her family and bring up her nine children. At the very least, Nuclear energy is going to act like Kalavati's…sorry, ""Kala's"" pond, and it is going to act as an insurance policy for this country in times of need. At its maximum, Nuclear energy is going to act like Kala's main crop. The problem is, that the way our nuclear industry is positioned today, it is going to do neither. It is neither going to act as an insurance policy, and nor is it going to act, or have the potential to act as a fundamental source of energy. And the reason it is not going to do so, is because the hands of our scientists, the hands of our establishment, are tied; and they are tied because they do not have fuel on one hand, and on the other hand, they do not have investment and technology. I am very proud to say that our Prime Minister Shri Manmohan Singh Ji has recognized both the problem and a potential solution. But it would be unfair of me not to accept that Shri Vajpayee also saw the problem, and also, in his time, worked on the solution.

I have stated, and all of us know, with regards to our energy security in this country, and that we need to think about it in the long term; and it is a problem that all of us need to solve working together. As I said, senior leaders have also established that he way forward is diversification and reliance on more than one source of energy- a balanced portfolio that includes nuclear, hydrocarbon, solar, and wind, among others. But it is not enough to identify a problem and a potential solution. The magic of what Shri Manmohan Singh Ji is doing, is that out of within the problem, he has identified an opportunity that is significantly larger than the problem itself. The opportunity our Prime Minister has identified is based on a simple fact. It is based on the fact that over the next 30-40 years, two countries are going to use the largest bulk of new energy that comes on line. These countries, China and India, have the ability to define the way the world's energy moves.

What I am suggesting, is that instead of looking at our energy problem as a problem, we start to look at our energy usage as an opportunity. Like a big buyer who goes to any market, we have the ability to shape the global energy industry. And Energy is like no other industry in the world. Energy is used everywhere, in everything, and in every aspect of economic and social life. Energy has destroyed nations, and it has built nations. Our old opponents, the British, grew to their prominence because they controlled coal. The United States today controls hydrocarbons, has a large emphasis on hydrocarbons; and we all know how powerful they are. What I am suggesting is that we start to think like a big country, like a powerful country, and instead of worrying about how the world will impact us, we start worrying about how we will impact the world. 

Many years ago, this country embarked on a path which many people did not believe in. we developed an industry, called the IT industry and the telecoms industry. Very few people believed at the time that India would ever play a major role in this industry; very few people believed that the computer would have anything to do with empowering the poor, and with changing the way this country worked. Yet today, all of us together see the impact of the computer, we see the revolutionary impact that IT and telecommunications has had on this country. And it is important that we do not forget this. It is important that we do not forget this because I believe we are at a crossroads very similar to the crossroads we were at when the decision on IT was to be made. The decision here is not about 3 percent energy or 7 percent energy. It is not about India's usage of nuclear energy. If we look at the big picture here, it is about whether India can become a global power in a type of energy which is going to be very important in the future.

We all know the problems posed by hydrocarbons, we know about pollution; and earlier, one of the members asked me to point out what the connection is between energy and poverty. And we know the link between us depending on hydrocarbons and prices in India today. When we think about energy, when we think about nuclear energy, we must think about the poorest in the country. Contrary to what most people believe, when we thought about the IT industry, we were thinking about the poor in this country. It is something that is hard to grasp, because it is counterintuitive. But one must not underestimate the connections between industry, between energy, and between the poor.
I have taken a lot of time, so I do not want to go on forever. But I just want to make one submission, one last submission- that I am very happy this house is now listening to me. The difference between a powerful country and a country that is not powerful and does not have a similar impact on the world stage, is that the powerful country thinks about how it will impact the world. The country that is not so powerful thinks about how the world would impact it. It does not matter which government runs this country. Many governments will run this country in the future. But it does matter how we think about our position in the world. What is important is that we stop worrying about how the world will impact us, we stop being scared about how the world will impact us, and we step out and worry about how we will impact the world.

I speak today not as a congress person or a congressman, but as an Indian. And I would like to say two other things before I conclude. The first- is that we are all building this country together. We might have different views about how this country should be built, we might have different opinions on what we should do, but essentially we sit in this room together and we have to solve our problems together. This is what differentiates us, and this is what gives us our true power- that any voice can be heard in this room, that any voice can disrupt any other voice in this room; it is uncomfortable for me, but I am very proud of it- that any voice can be heard in this country.

And I would like to conclude by saying two things- the first thing, is that we must never, ever, let fear be our guide. We must never take decisions based on the fear of the unknown, or what is what going to happen if we act. And we must only act with one rule- that is Courage. And the second thing that I would like to say, is that we are a country of a billion people. 70 percent of us are young. I am old for this country; I am much above the average age. And it is important to realize that this country is brimming with confidence, and brimming with self-belief. And another point we must not forget when we take decisions as leaders in this country, is that we have to believe in our people, we have to have confidence in what they are capable of doing. I think these are guides not only for Congress leaders, these are guides for every single Indian- that when you do act, whoever you are, whatever opinion you have, act with courage and act with confidence. And with that, together we can change this country and impact the world.
To conclude, I would like to support our Prime Minister, and like to say that he has shown tremendous courage and confidence in the Indian people. And I would also like to say, and I say this as a youngster from this party, and a youngster from that party and all those other parties, that it does not matter what happens here today, what matters is that we start working together and together try to solve the problems of this country. I would like to support the motion of the Prime Minister.",Lok Sabha Debates,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150173045634921.306224.24967709920/10151091246059921/?type=3,2012-08-07 01:25:41,1403,141,154,1403,0,0,0,0,0

http://youtu.be/AOUktxk2u7U
My general impression about Orissa is that the Tribal areas are quite cut-off and the government's programs are unable to reach them. I felt the same about Chhattisgarh.
 
The impression that I got after touring Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, UP, and even Bundelkhand is that our Systems are not reaching the poorest and most backward sections of our society effectively. This system has difficulties in listening to the voices of the Adivasis, especially in Chhattisgarh and Orissa. That's my point. I went to many villages here and most of them face the same situation. The NREGS or the Indira Awas program, if it reaches, does not reach the poorest. The system is unable to identify the neediest.)
 On Salwa Judum and Naxalism
The Supreme Court has given its decision on Salwa Judum, and in my opinion, it should be respected. The Supreme Court is the highest court of the country, and when the Supreme Court says something, that is the law.
 
With regard to Naxalism, I think it's related to what I said earlier. Our government, in states like Chhattisgarh and Orissa is not able to touch the poorest of the poor, it is not reaching the poorest of the poor. That has an impact on Naxalism.
 On 'Forgotten India'There are two parts of India. One part is the part you see in the urban areas, which is growing very fast. There is another part of India, which is a forgotten part of India, and Tribals, Adivasis, here in Chhatisgarh, Dalits in Bundelkhand, they are part of that forgotten India. What I am trying to see with my own eyes and understand, is- what are the sentiments of that forgotten India? ; The India that our government systems are not responding to. On responsible Industrialization
The idea is not to stop industrialization. The idea is to create a fair deal for the people who are displaced by industrialization. Development does involve certain pain in it, the idea is that the voice of these people, for example, the voice of the people in the Niamgiri Hills must be heard, it must not just be brushed aside. These people in the Niamgiri Hills, for example, they have a particular culture, they have certain traditions; those traditions and that culture are being completely destroyed.
So there is a middle path in this. What is happening in my view in the Niamgiri Hills is that their voice is not being heard at all, and that is what I think is wrong.
 On being a youth leaderI don't think it's a matter of political style. I think the more of these youngsters are in positions to enter politics, in positions of responsibility, and are able to make change, the better it is. So I think, (my strategy aims at) including as many youngsters as possible in politics.   
People will say whatever they want to say (about me). The way I view my duty, it is to go and listen to people. There are two parts of India, one part which is being heard, and another part which is not being heard. I think it is important to listen to the part that is not being heard.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10151091271564921/?type=3,2012-08-07 01:46:09,982,111,118,982,0,0,0,0,0
24967709920_10151091254384921,"Speech by Rahul Gandhi BUDGET 2008-09

Mr. Speaker Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in support of the
budget 2008-2009.
Each one of us is responsible for listening to the people of India and reflecting their
voices in this august house. It is therefore a privilege for me to put forth my views
here today.
1
Mr. Speaker Sir, there are two distinct voices among India's people today. The louder
of these voices comes from an India that is empowered, an India that has proven to
itself and to the world that it will shape the future. It is an India rich with opportunity
and talent, straining to be unleashed.
The other voice is yet to be empowered. It is not as loud, but reverberates across the
country. It is the voice of disenfranchised people reminding us that they too have
potential to fulfil. They too are enterprising, hardworking, and self-reliant, and they
ask only to be given an opportunity.
Some believe that the progress of these two India's is not just separable but mutually
exclusive. Some believe that India can shine only when we direct attention and
resources to those Indians who already soar, while ignoring the aspirations of the
disempowered. Others believe that the poor will progress only if we stifle our
nation's entrepreneurial energy.
Our government believes that India's growth can and must be symbiotic. The two
India's are fundamentally inseparable. Our philosophy is not to choose which India
to nurture, but to grow together.

There are two reasons for this view.
First, the poverty of our people is an assault on our principles. Freedom from
poverty is not a matter of charity or luck; it is a right. I am proud that under the
leadership of the Prime Minister, our government has recognized and institutionalized
this idea. The NREGA delivers employment as a right. The Tribal Act delivers
ownership of land as a right. The RTI Act delivers information as a right. The
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill seeks to deliver basic minimums rights to those
being displaced.
Second, the speed and continuity of our economic growth depend on inclusion. A
small, resource-rich section of India cannot grow indefinitely while a vast,
disempowered nation looks on. If opportunity is limited to a few, our growth will be
a fraction of our capability as a nation.
Mr. Speaker Sir, permit me to give an example to illustrate why it is crucial to connect
these two India's:
On the one hand we have thousands of young Indians looking for jobs. On the other
we have a galloping industry with massive manpower demand. But we have invested
too little in developing the skills of our youth. This renders them unqualified to do
the jobs our industries require.
Indian enterprise will realize its full potential not by distancing itself from the poor,
but by fully connecting with their aspirations.
Mr. Speaker Sir, the true magnitude of our economic potential will only be realized
when the voices of the empowered and the aspiring speak as one. This is the core of
our 'aam aadmi' agenda.

I compliment the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for giving us a budget that
stays true to this goal.
A strong voice begins with effective education. The allocation of Rs 34,400 crores to
education will allow for 2 lakh more teachers and 5 lakh more classrooms. It will also
provide for programs such as mid-day meals, means based scholarships and schools
for girls so that the most vulnerable voices are clearly heard. Our investments in
expanding IITs, IIMs and other institutions of higher learning will ensure that our
brightest minds continue to shine on the world stage. The budget invests extensively
in vocational education and the creation of a National Skills Development
Organization. This will ensure that our technical training institutions will respond
effectively to the voice of our youth.
Mr. Speaker Sir, permit me to reflect on a subject critical to our nation's future. The
UPA government has given the nation an education budget 3 and a half times what it
inherited. However, we must acknowledge that there are deep structural issues with
our delivery infrastructure. It is my conviction that our schools and universities will
become worthy of our nation's voice only when the education sector undergoes a
revolution of the kind we saw in telecommunications.
Returning to the budget at hand. A child's voice is much stronger when it is healthy,
well fed and sheltered. Our Government has recognized and provided for this. The
Rs 16,500 crores allocated to health will help combat illness and disease. Allocations
to programs such as Bharat Nirman, the Indira Awaas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gram
Sadak Yojana and Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission are delivering to
Indians everywhere a minimum standard of life.
The budget pays special attention to the poor and makes provisions to support our
most marginalized people. The allocation planned for NREGA will take the program

4
nation wide and give every eligible Indian access to basic social support. The
allocation to the Backward Regions Grant Fund will allow us to correct inequalities by
directly targeting devastated and chronically neglected regions such as Bundelkhand
and K-B-K.
This year's budget has especially heeded the plea of the debt-ridden farmer. A
historic decision has been taken to free 40 million of our poorest farmers from the
bonds of indebtedness. This decision has corrected a grave injustice and given our
small and marginal farmers the ability to look to the future with hope.
Mr. Speaker Sir, our nation's social objectives are being achieved without burdening
the economy or the taxpayer. Our economy has grown at 8.8% under the
stewardship of the Prime Minister. The UPA government continues to bolster
economic growth. The exemption threshold for personal income tax has been raised
to Rs. one lakh fifty thousand. The government maintains its sharp focus on enabling
enterprise through the creation of infrastructure. For example, the allocation for road
transport and highways has risen 70% to Rs. 17,550 crores during the tenure of our
government. The continued emphasis on Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal
Mission encourages states to build urban infrastructure capable of absorbing the
massive migration to our cities.
Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to put forward some suggestions.
The loan waiver brings tremendous relief to our farmers. I have discussed the
scheme with several experts and would like to make two points.
First, the current ceiling of 2 hectares for eligible farmers does not account for land
productivity and excludes deserving farmers in poorly irrigated areas. I refer

5
specifically to dry land areas like Vidarbha. Perhaps, Sir, we could consider making
the land ceiling variable based upon land productivity.
Second, in some parts of the country, the cropping cycles are such that the bulk of
loans have been taken after the cut-off date of March 31, 2007. A single cut-off date
unfairly penalizes farmers in these regions. Sir, it would greatly help if localized cutoff
dates were considered so that every deserving farmer benefits from the waiver.
Finally, Sir, I would like to make a few suggestions regarding service delivery,
accountability and transparency in institutions and programs.
Recently, some colleagues and I conducted an evaluation of NREGA in our
constituencies and high-performing states. We compiled a set of recommendations
that we presented to the Honourable Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker Sir, I humbly
submit to the Finance Minister that a host of government programs would be better
implemented if funds transfers were linked to achieving RTI and social audit
objectives.
Sir, the budget establishes total financial inclusion as a key objective, and specifically
targets SHGs as instruments to access credit. Sir, building SHGs is a resourceintensive
process. I humbly request the Finance Minister to consider budgetary
provisions and incentives to encourage states to build SHG networks which
comprehensively cover the poor.
Finally, Sir, in dwelling upon accountability and transparency, I cannot omit to
mention our Panchayati Raj Institutions. Panchayati Raj brings the voice of even the
poorest Indian into decisions shaping their lives. Therefore, Mr. Speaker Sir, I
humbly urge the Finance Minister to place PRIs at the centre of program
implementation and create incentives for states to do the same.

With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I conclude my submission by once again complimenting
the Prime Minister and the UPA government on a landmark budget.
Thank You.",,status,,2012-08-07 01:32:31,288,38,9,288,0,0,0,0,0

Watch the complete speech here
http://smarturl.it/RahulGandhi

It was his first speech after becoming General Secretary of the party. During the day he was praised by the party seniors from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee. 

He appealed to the youth to join the Congress to build institutions are worthy of their dreams and capabilities.

In his short speech he was cheered by the gathering of Congress members that included his mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Singh and Union Ministers, Chief Ministers and leaders from various parts of the country.

Rahul Gandhi said that wherever he went in his recent tours, he was asked two questions by the youth and members of
the NSUI and Youth Congress. The non-party youth wanted to know how they could join politics and serve the country, while the party youth asked him ""how do we progress in our organisation"".

Mr. Gandhi himself answered the questions, saying ""If we are to truly become an organisation that represents the youth of our country, if we are to truly develop leaders of whom this nation can be proud, we need to do two things. The first is to build an organisation that is open and relevant to a broad range of Indians who believe in our values and seek to serve the nation"". 

""The second is to build a meritocratic organisation. Young people bring tremendous passion and energy into our organisation. We must see to it that they are accountable. It
is our duty to ensure that their progress is linked to their performance,"" he said.

Mr. Gandhi made a brief ten-minute speech, first in Hindi and then in English that outlined his vision for the party and his political thought.

He was welcomed with a huge garland by Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and DPCC President J P Aggarwal, who presented a photograph of Rajiv Gandhi to him. 

During his brief speech Mr. Gandhi unveiled his political vision. He said that the ''aam admi'' was the greatest asset of the country and called for creating opportunities for them in a resurgent India. 

He said the true realisation of India's power lay in igniting the fire of ambition of the country's aspiring millions. In order for this flame to spread, India needs to be connected within itself and the rest of the world.

He said India needs to be connected physically through roads, electricity, telecommunication, railways and other infrastructure. ''We also need to connect India intellectually through literacy, education and training. Finally, we need to connect India economically through the creation of jobs and livelihood,"" he added.''",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/India.RahulGandhi/photos/a.10150191619149921.323946.24967709920/10152533953884921/?type=3,2014-07-14 13:28:15,678,31,82,678,0,0,0,0,0

SHRI RAHUL GANDHI (AMETHI): Sir, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak in support of the Budget, 2006-07. 

It is my understanding that this House may not find time to discuss the Demands for Grants for Human Resource Development. Therefore, I have taken liberty to focus attention on education in this debate. 

Sir, India is emerging as a global power.  We are poised to grow at 8 per cent.  This achievement is built on the dreams of millions of our people.  It is built on the dreams of our leaders and teachers.  But most importantly, it IS built on the aspirations of our students.  Equally, we owe our success to our toiling masses, to our farmers and our workers.  I salute them.  But it is not enough to salute them.  We must work for an India where a son does not remain tied with his father's past and where a daughter has an opportunity to do something which her mother could only dream of.  And education is the key to achieving this.

Sir, as I travel round the country, I come to realise that education is not about schools, colleges and universities.  It is about the dreams and aspirations of people.  A successful educational system must do two things.  It must allow all young Indians to dream and it must teach them those skills to turn those dreams into reality.  About a year ago, I visited a village school.  I walked upto a village student and asked him, ""¤Éä]É, ¤É½ä cÉäBÉE® BÉDªÉÉ ¤ÉxÉÉäMÉä?""  The silent stare which I got in reply disturbed me.  In school after school, I have asked this question.  And in school after school, I have got no answer.  Many students, teachers and parents believe that our system is a dead end.  In village after village, there are children who do not have an opportunity to go to school[bru24].

Many parents are convinced that only the rich can go to universities.  As I speak, Sir, our education system is crushing the aspirations of these children. But I have also visited the schools where every child aspires to greatness.  They struggle against adversities and keep the dreams alive.  The village schools where the same system, which destroys the aspirations elsewhere, makes the child of the landless labourer dream of becoming a software engineer.  I have been moved by children in a School for Blind, who spoke to me about their dreams.  There are IIT graduates who run billion dollar companies. 

            As I speak, Sir, our education system is fuelling all these people. Why do we have this paradox? This must be addressed.  As a Government, we must inspire our children to dream.  To do this we need to focus on two big ideas.  First, we must ensure that our education system reaches as many students as possible;  second, we must improve the quality of our education system by increasing accountability. 

            The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme attack the first problem. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has young children, including girls who otherwise might not get a chance to get education.  The Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the largest such programme in the world, allows the poor parents to send their children to the school. 

Since it came to power, the UPA Government under the leadership of our Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has more than tripled the money for these programmes.  Over the last two years these programmes have reduced drop out of children by over 39 lakhs.  This is nothing short of revolution.  I am confident that the basic foundation of our rural and urban poor shall be enriched  beyond our expectations. 

The importance that this Government gives to education in UP and Bihar is reflected by the fact that fifty per cent of the total money goes to these two States alone.  The real impact of these programmes needs to be made in the villages of UP and Bihar. 

We have made progress in primary education.  But according to estimates, only 39 per cent of our children go to secondary schools and only six per cent of our children go to colleges.  The Government, the NGOs and the private sector must work together to change this.  Secondary and higher education must become widely available to all our children and must provide options for vocational and technical training. 

The Government's statistics show that in some northern States, on an average, a child takes over ten years to complete primary school.  I am not questioning the ability of our students.  What I am talking about is quality and accountability of our schools.  This lack of quality is particularly harmful because it discriminates against our poor children.  The rich students have alternatives.  For a poor student, a bad school is the end of the road. 

I am new to politics and still have a lot to learn.  But if there is one thing that I have learnt is that people who are closer to a problem understands it best.  Empower them, make them accountable and you will get results.  Community institutions can play powerful role in improving the quality of our local schools.  Teacher absenteeism and poor performance are the major problems.  Handing the decision-making powers to parents and communities directly affected by the problem is our best bet to solving it.  There is enough evidence from our own country to support this. 

As we emerge  as a global power our higher education and vocational training can no longer function in a vacuum.  Two years ago I visited a university in a North-Eastern State.   I met a university topper who was unemployed.  Now, here is an exceptional person, a person who has followed the path laid out for him perfectly.  But after fifteen years of hard work  he discovers that our system has led him nowhere.  It has crushed his dreams.  We cannot afford to judge universities and vocational training institutes simply by the number of degrees they give out.  We must also start judging them by the number of quality of jobs that their students get.  To give people productive employment our education system needs to be connected to the job market.  Our education system has to deepen its links with industry, with research and development, with technology and with finance.   It is only by building these links that we will move from creating job seekers to enterpreneurs[r25].

 

            Sir, the fact is that in order to increase the scale and quality of our education system, we need financial resources.  For this, we have to think in innovative ways.  The UPA Government has more than doubled spending on education. The Prarambikh Shiksha Kosh, to which Rs.8,746 crore is being added in 2006-07, is a significant step forward.  The statement on revenue forgone points out that a figure of Rs.1,58,000 crore has been forgone by the Government as a result of departure from the normal tax regime.  Mentioning this figure for the first time is a positive step.  But it would be very helpful if the Government could elaborate on how it intends to act on this information.  This is important because even if we are able to reduce revenue forgone by 15 per cent, it will raise enough money to double our country's allocation for education.

            Finally, Sir, the development of India as a global education hub could be a new way of expanding our higher education system.  Today, we are recognized as leaders in higher education.  The United States and the United Kingdom earn over Rs.50,000 crore from Asian students studying there.  This is more than twice our entire educational budget.  Can we not try to capture some of these revenues to supplement and grow our higher education system?  Nalanda and Vikramshila were the Harvard and Cambridge of their day. Why can we not revive this tradition?  But I do want to stress that whatever we do, no Indian boy or girl should be deprived of higher education because they cannot afford it. This is the primary responsibility of the Government.

            Mr. Speaker, Sir, every human endeavour starts with an aspiration, a dream or belief. Sir, we stand in this House as representatives of the people of India.  We do so because we believe in our people; we believe in our future.  It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that every child dreams and that every child has the skills to turn those dreams into reality.  Let us ensure that every child is able to answer the question: ¤É½ä cÉäBÉE® BÉDªÉÉ ¤ÉxÉÉäMÉä?

 

            Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for letting me put forward my views on the Budget.  I support the Budget 2006-07.

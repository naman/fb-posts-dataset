Throughout history, the most harrowing stories of human survival--like that of the Donner Party in the 1840s--have involved people whose only means of staying alive was to cannibalize the deceased around them. On Friday the 13th of October, 1972, just such a story began when a charter plane carrying 45 rugby team members crashed in the remote Andes Mountains. For 72 days, the world thought they were dead. But what 16 survivors endured was far worse than death, driven to what would become headline-making acts of cannibalism in their struggle for life. Now, through the first person, on-camera account of one of the survivors, Nando Parrado, experience the nearly two and half months of heroism and tragedy through the eyes and memories of the man who lived it. His experience will also become a window for viewers into the history of other stories of extreme survival.","Watch an All New Special ""I Am Alive"" on HISTORY Tonight at 9/8c",video,https://www.facebook.com/HISTORY/videos/901889968145/,2010-10-20 16:45:07,819,180,6,819,0,0,0,0,0

Today, more than ever, food service venders offer increasingly finer fare, but American fans still eat more hot dogs than any other ballpark food--22 million a year at Major League ballparks alone.

When you wash it down with a draft beer, would you believe a flower is responsible for its bitter taste? And, there is more to that tasty morsel at the bottom of a Drumstick than just sweetness. Bobby Bognar travels to Washington's Yakima Valley to help farmers grow the spice of beer. In Michigan, he uncovers how a special hybrid of popcorn is vital to making Cracker Jack.

In 1994 a secret manuscript hidden in the Vatican Library revealed a previously unknown apocalyptic prophesy credited to history's most notorious seer, Michel de Nostradamus. Where did this ""Lost Book"" come from and who was its author? The answers to these questions might help establish whether the horrible illustrations in the book point to mankind's violent end. Although the book's cover displays the name Michel Nostradamus, some believe the true author is his eldest son, Cesar. Was Cesar Nostradamus also a prophet? One who struggled with his own visions? Did he, like his father, operate in the shadow of a powerful and unforgiving Church? And was he, too, cursed with the ability to see mankind's doomed future in order to warn future generations?

Astonishing Final Chapter of America's Most Revered President
In the two-hour premiere special
STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY
On HISTORY™ on Monday, February 16, at 9-11 pm ET

Featured in special are new digital visualizations of Lincoln
that show him moving and walking for the first time
 
NEW YORK, JAN. 21, 2009 – As millions celebrate the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln this year, HISTORY™ presents perhaps the last unknown story of our 16th president – the shocking plot to steal his body.

Lincoln's assassination in April 1865 plunged the nation into mourning.  After lying in state at the White House and at the Capitol (the nation's first presidential state funeral), Lincoln's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states and nearly two thousand miles, arriving in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois on May 4.  However, his final burial would not take place until 1901, thirty six years later.

Before Lincoln finally came to rest in a steel-and-concrete-reinforced underground vault in Springfield, the President's body was repeatedly exhumed and moved, his coffin frequently opened. An astonishing and macabre series of events also included a diabolical bodysnatching-for-ransom scheme.  This remarkable final chapter is the subject of the gripping two-hour special STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY on HISTORY™ on Monday, February 16 at 9pm ET.  

STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY examines the extraordinary confluence of historical trends and cultural movements that prompted this forgotten moment in American history—the age of counterfeiting, the birth of the Secret Service, the popularizing of the science of embalming (from the Civil War), the importance of secret societies in American life (including the one that was formed to safeguard Lincoln's body through the ages), and the advent of the rural cemetery movement. 
Bringing this astounding story to life like no other before it, the program features moving images of Abraham Lincoln, digitally created from actual historical photographs. For the first time, Lincoln walks and moves according to the historical record.  The moving images and some of the stills showcase the first ""virtual photography"" of Lincoln and the only ""virtual motion"" pictures of him ever created. Using computer-generated imagery, it illustrates key sections of the story and brings them to life, often with startling effect. 

These new photographs and moving images of Lincoln highlight a level of historical detail and information never seen before. Ray Downing of Studio Macbeth, who created these digital effects for STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY, explains the technique began as a kind of experiment using contemporary film technology.  It gives the modern audience an opportunity to ""gaze upon the noble face of our most beloved president, to see him walk down the street, to see him alive again…. Today's technology allows us to achieve a level of photographic realism previously unattainable, with the added bonus of motion graphics.""  

Author and Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, who is interviewed in STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY, says:  ""The result—an uncanny, believable, realistic, living Lincoln—moving before our eyes as he must have in life, wholly imagined yet based on actual photos—took my breath away. Here is the man who lived, laughed, spoke, walked, for precious seconds practically born again."" 

In 1876, 11 years after Lincoln's assassination, a band of Chicago counterfeiters devised a fantastic plot to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom. They wanted $200,000 and the release of the gang's master engraver who was in prison in Illinois.  The Secret Service – recently formed to deal with the country's ballooning counterfeiting problem – infiltrated the gang with an informer.  Yet it also set in motion a cringe-inducing chain of events in which a group of well-intentioned, self-appointed guardians took it upon themselves to protect Lincoln's remains by any means necessary.

Some efforts to protect the remains of the 16th President of the United States would prove to be equally misguided and macabre. Finally, in 1901, thirty six years after Lincoln's assassination, Robert Todd Lincoln had the body of his father interred in a massive concrete vault. The contrast between the nation's reverence for Abraham Lincoln and the shocking manner in which his body had been treated is striking.  This strange story of Lincoln at un-rest reveals how important this man was to so many, and perhaps our reluctance to let such a beloved and visionary leader go.  This may indeed be the last, unknown chapter in the story of Abraham Lincoln.

STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY is part of a year-long, national initiative announced in 2008 by HISTORY and its partners to commemorate the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. The initiative was launched in November 2008 at Lincoln's birthplace in Hodgenville, Kentucky, and will stretch across programming, digital, and grass-roots platforms, in partnership with the National Park Foundation and the National Trust for Historic preservation.  Its centerpiece is GIVE A LINCOLN FOR LINCOLN™, with Outback Steakhouse as its title sponsor.  The goal is to encourage contributions to help preserve six key sites associated with Lincoln's life and legacy.
STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY is produced for HISTORY by Left/Right. Executive Producer for History is Carl H. Lindahl.

TWO HOUR EVENT Sunday January 4th at 9 PM only on History

NOSTRADAMUS: 2012 takes a detailed investigation of this chilling prophecy. This explosive two-hour sequel picks up where The Lost Book of Nostradamus left off. NOSTRADAMUS: 2012 seeks answers to key critical questions that may loom in just four years: Is there any modern scientific proof that such an alignment will indeed happen? Is any other compelling evidence throughout history that 2012 will be a year of unprecedented, even deadly, upheaval?

There is no disputing that we are a planet in crisis, and that there is a growing public obsession with 2012.  But there is no cogent distinction between the sobering facts and hysterical fiction. What, if any, is the scientific ballast that substantiates the fears? NOSTRADAMUS: 2012 will look for the parallels between the nightmarish daily headlines and the 2012 prophecies from Nostradamus and others.

From the mystical realms of the Guatemalan jungles to the high-tech corridors of NASA; from the Hopi elders and Mayan shaman to the most respected thinkers of the modern age; from the symbology of the ancient pyramids in Mexico and Egypt to that of the gothic cathedrals and monuments of Europe -- the 2012 doomsday warning will be cast in a frighteningly modern context.  December 21, 2012 is bearing down on us with alarming speed - and whether or not we are able to collectively heed the warnings and affect a course to avert disaster may be the defining moment of the modern age.","NOSTRADAMUS: 2012 premieres Jan 4, 2009",video,https://www.facebook.com/HISTORY/videos/50214624852/,2008-12-16 11:06:09,89,6,69,89,0,0,0,0,0

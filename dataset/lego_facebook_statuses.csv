6665038402_10154487645463403,"Learn some of the amazing milestones your 4-year-old may reach and how to help make the most of this action-packed year.

THEY SEE THE WORLD IN 3D

Your kids realize, through the joyful trial and error of constructive play, what fits together and what doesn't. At 4, children can also draw a person with different body parts (a more or less recognizable head, torso, and limbs) and will enjoy making 3-D versions with bricks. Applaud their newfound abilities and ask them to tell you all about their creations.

THEY CAN TELL A WHOLE STORY

Your 4-year-old's language skills are growing by leaps and bound. They become wildly imaginative storytellers, narrating the action as they build a barn or spaceship with LEGO Juniors.

THEY ARE CONSTANTLY COMPARING THINGS

By the age of 4 your little one is becoming aware of differences between people, places, and things, and constantly making comparisons: big and small, tall and short, square and rectangle. This brain work feels like a fun challenge to them. Encourage such sorting by role modeling: ""I'm going to collect all the blue bricks to make an ocean—what do you want to collect?""

THEY ARE VERY SOCIAL

By 4, children are actually playing with other children instead of just side-by-side in the same room. Fun group activities build all kinds of social skills—sharing, taking turns, and what the experts call ""cooperative play."" A LEGO Juniors playdate is a terrific rainy day activity for any size gathering of your little ones.
Their patience is growing (really.) At 4, they're not out of the tantrum woods yet—but kids can focus for longer periods of time, and being immersed in play is a terrific way to do it. Constructive play also helps them learn how to approach a project step by step!",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/LEGO/photos/a.10150175674793403.303596.6665038402/10154487645463403/?type=3,2017-03-07 05:00:00,406,20,19,375,29,0,0,1,1

Dan was in special education all his life because he had limited speaking vocabulary. But on the Coursera platform, he can watch lectures at his own pace and communicate through typing at a college level. As a result, a learner who was placed in the remedial learning track has taken and excelled at advanced level poetry and history courses...AND has been invited by a University of Pennsylvania professor to be a Community Teaching Assistant. We are incredibly motivated by Dan so much so that we painted him on one of our conference room walls. 

It was priceless for us to see his giddy reaction when he saw his own portrait. Dan, you make us as a company (and as individuals) better through the example you set in love for learning and perseverance.

Facts: 
> Land: Covering less than 2% of the Earth's surface area, rainforests are home to 50% of the Earth's plants and animals. At the current rate of tropical forest loss, 5–10% of rainforest species will be lost per decade. 
> Sea: Coral reefs are critical to maintain ocean's entire ecosystem. As more carbon dioxide enters the ocean from practices like overfishing, fishing using cyanide and dynamite, etc. 75% of remaining coral reefs are currently threatened, and many have already been lost. 
> Air: Giant livestock farms (aka ""Factory Farms) contribute to the release of concentrated amounts of toxic gases into the air such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can travel for hundreds of miles. They also release methane into the air (a greenhouse gas), which causes a ""rotten egg"" smell. 

Easy ways you can help:  

> Reduce paper usage: tote reusable grocery bags, make used envelopes scrap paper, craft homemade cards from old magazines, get off the mailing lists of catalogs, etc. 
> Eat fish and meats consciously and from sustainable sources. Better yet, consider reducing your intake of animal products entirely!

""I recommend Dr. José J. Vázquez-Cognet's course for anyone who wants to get an introduction to #economics. It steps through basic models that explain the relationships between supply, demand and cost in a market. Dr. Vázquez-Cognet spends much of his lecture time deftly hand-drawing curves and explaining models, but the best part is where he relates the abstract concepts to local businesses that he personally visits.  Through this course, you will be able to relate microeconomics theories with the markets you see around you.

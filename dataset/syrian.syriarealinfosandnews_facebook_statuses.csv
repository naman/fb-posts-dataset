MOSCOW, April 29 - RIA Novosti. ""The Syrian Democratic Forces"" (SDF), based on the Kurdish militia, continue to take over the Syrian city of Tabka and move toward the center, the Kurdish Firat agency reported.
Heavy confrontations between the SDF and the Islamic State (IS) * began Saturday morning around the local Watani hospital, the agency said. This hospital had been transformed by IS militants into one of their headquarters, where wounded militants were also treated. The SDF started its attack in the morning.
A group of militants attempted to break the siege by car, but was destroyed.
During the day, the SDF managed to penetrate the city for a depth of 1 km.
In addition, the SDF has organized the evacuation of civilians from hazardous areas - such as the al-Wahab area, where two thousand people have been evacuated. Among them - three children who had been injured by IS bombings, the agency reported.
The bulk of SDS forces consist of Kurdish militia, and local Arab tribes. The operation was supported by US aircraft and special forces. In turn, this has led to the official protest of Damascus, which emphasizes that Americans act without the consent of the Syrian government, and their presence in northern Syria is in fact proven by the intervention

""Le forze democratiche siriane"" hanno circondato la sede della IG * in Tabka

MOSCA, 29 Aprile - RIA Novosti. ""Le forze democratiche siriane "" (SDF), basate sulla milizia curda, continuano a prendere d'assalto la citt√† siriana di Tabka e si muovono verso il centro, ha riferito l'agenzia curda Firat.
Pesanti scontri tra l'SDF e lo ""stato islamico"" (IS) * sono iniziati nella mattinata di sabato intorno all'ospedale locale ""Watani"", segnala l'agenzia. Questo ospedale era stato trasformato dai militanti dell'ISRS in uno dei loro quartier generali, dove venivano anche curati i militanti feriti. L'SDF ha iniziato il suo attacco di mattina.
Un gruppo di militanti ha tentato di rompere l'assedio in macchina, ma √® stato distrutto.
Durante il giorno, l'SDF √® riuscita a penetrare nella citt√† per la profondit√† di 1 km.
Inoltre, l'SDF ha organizzato l'evacuazione dei civili dalle zone pericolose - come, la zona di al-Wahab, dove duemila persone sono state evacuate. Tra essi - tre bambini che erano stati feriti dai bombardamenti dell'ISIS, ha riferito l'agenzia.
Il grosso delle forze dell'SDF √® costituito dalle milizie curde, e da trib√π arabe locali. L'operazione √® stata supportata da aerei statunitensi e dalle forze speciali. A sua volta, questo ha portato alle proteste ufficiale di Damasco, che sottolinea come gli americani agiscano senza il consenso del governo siriano, e la loro presenza nel nord della Siria, infatti, √® provata dall'intervento.

Ford ha spiegato che l'Isis √® il risultato delle azioni della ex capo dell'intelligence saudita, il principe Bandar bin Sultan, aggiungendo che tale piano ha avuto il consenso degli Stati Uniti.
Ford ha precisato che l'Isis √® stato costituito al fine di unificare i vari gruppi estremisti e i resti del partito Baath in Iraq, fedeli a Saddam Hussein, definendo questa azione come un errore storico.
L'ex Ambasciatore USA in Siria ha aggiunto che l'Arabia Saudita √® stata negli ultimi tre decenni la fonte del terrorismo e dell'estremismo che si estendono in tutto il Medio Oriente e che hanno avuto gravi conseguenze non solo per la regione, ma anche per l'Europa.
Infine, il diplomatico ha affermato che l'Arabia Saudita continua ancora oggi con la politica di sostegno al terrorismo armando Al Qaeda in Yemen per contrastare i sostenitori di Ansarul√° e l'esercito yemenita.

Syria strongly condemned the frantic campaign of misleading and lies and fabricated allegations launched by French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault regarding the crime of Khan Sheikhoun, stressing that the lies and allegations of the French Government represent a blatant aggression and an outrageous violation of the authorities of the international organizations specialized in this regard in attempt to hide the truth of this crime and who stands behind it.

Foreign and Expatriates Ministry said that ""The Syrian Arab Republic condemns the frantic campaign of misleading and lies and the fabricated allegations launched by French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault regarding the crime of Khan Sheikhoun which shows without any doubt the involvement of France in preparing this crime in the framework of its full partnership in the aggression on #Syria.""

""The French Government doesn't have legal qualification or competence to decide what took place in Khan Sheikhoun and to jump to conclusions, and what it has circulated of lies and allegations represent a blatant violation of the authorizations of the specialized international organizations in an attempt to hide the truth of this crime and who stands behind it, and the objection of France and its allies at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on the Russian-Iranian draft resolution on forming a neutral and professional investigation committee clearly proves that "" The Ministry added.

The Ministry indicated that ""The Western states have become professional in the art of lying, deception and misleading to implement their policies in imposing hegemony on the world and to return to the eras of colonization, mandate and guardianship.""

The Ministry clarified that ""what took place in Iraq and Libya proves this approach and the crime of Khan Sheikhoun comes in the same context of the conspiratorial project on Syria to raise the collapsed morale of the armed terrorist groups after the successive defeats inflicted upon them by the Syrian Arab army and to undermine the efforts which aim at finding a political solution to the crisis.""

The Ministry concluded by saying ""The French Government which have failed a time after time and has been strongly condemned by the French people through the overwhelming defeat of the candidate of the ruling Socialist Party in the first round of the presidential elections, will not be able to flee to the foreign policy to hide its failures because its ruling was truly a story of failure in the internal and foreign policy and a title of moral regression whose first and most important victim was the status of France and its reputation in the international arena.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1569711149713859/?type=3,2017-04-27 19:10:53,12,1,1,11,1,0,0,0,0
782503618434620_1569707743047533,"Moscow: Israeli aggression on military site southwest of Damascus Airport violates international law

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova affirmed on Thursday that the Israeli aggression on a military site southwest of Damascus Airport violates international law and is in the interests of terrorists.

In a press conference in Moscow, Zakharova said that Moscow condemns acts of aggression against Syria and regards them as impermissible and running counter to international law which cannot be justified because this violation is destabilizing and is in the interest of the terrorists, like Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS, and obstructing the reaching of a settlement of the crisis in Syria on the basis of international resolutions, particularly resolution no.2254.

""We are urging all to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria, a UN member-state,"" she said.

Zakharova expressed her country's deep concern about the bombing of Turkey to border areas in northeastern Syria and northern Iraq, stressing that the US aggression on al-Shairat airfield in the countryside of Homs had encouraged Ankara to commit this aggression.

She hoped that Astana meeting next week will achieve positive results and prevent the deterioration of the situation in Syria, adding that Syrian parties should be supported in reaching compromises that put an end to the ongoing confrontation in Syria and that Russia will not allow the terrorists to impose their control over the country and the entire Middle East region.

In a related context, Zakharova said that there are many facts and information to prove that the so-called White Helmets are working for the terrorists and fabricating films and false scenarios about the tragedy of people to discredit the Syrian forces and the Russian military.
""The White Helmets not only feel at home on territories controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra and the ISIS but also openly express positive attitude towards them, provide information and even financial assistance to them,"" she said.

""There is documentary evidence proving that White Helmets members participated in some operations carried out by Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as covered up the signs of civilian executions,"" she added.

She noted that the Swedish NGO Doctors for Human Rights had accused the White Helmets of falsifying information about their humanitarian work in Syria by producing staged videos. ""They analyzed a video and came to the conclusion that the people in the video were dealing with kids who were under the influence of drugs, rather than trying to provide them with medical assistance,"" Zakharova stressed.

She added that Moscow is doing all it can to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrians without discrimination, including the besieged areas of Deir Ezzor, calling on the West to deal with the humanitarian issue in the same manner and stop the attempts to impose additional sanctions on Syrians.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1569707743047533/?type=3,2017-04-27 19:06:48,60,9,6,51,0,0,3,0,6

782503618434620_1569693593048948,"President al-Assad to Telesur: Stopping outside support to terrorists and reconciliation among Syrians are means to restore security to Syria ‚Äì video
(corto commento italiano e russo sotto)

President Bashar al-Assad affirmed that the objective of the American and western allegations about chemical weapons is to support terrorists in Syria.

President al-Assad added in an interview given to Venezuelan Telesur TV that the solution in Syria should be through stopping outside support to the terrorists and reconciliation among the Syrians.

Following is the full text of the interview;

Journalist: Mr. President, thank you for receiving us.

President Assad: I welcome you and teleSUR TV in Syria. You are welcome.

Question 1: Let's start directly with the latest developments. Russia has warned that there might be other alleged chemical attacks. What are the precautionary measures that Syria has taken in order to prevent that?

President Assad: First of all, terrorists have used chemical materials more than once in the past several years and in more than one region throughout Syria. We have asked the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to send specialized missions to investigate what happened. And every time, the United States obstructed these investigations or prevented sending such missions in order to carry out such investigations. This is what happened last week when we called for investigations over the alleged use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The United States and its allies prevented OPCW from taking that decision. As far as we are concerned, we still insist on an investigation, and we and our Russian and Iranian allies are trying to persuade OPCW to send a team to investigate what happened, because if it doesn't, the United States might repeat the same charade by fabricating the use of false chemical weapons in another place in Syria in order to justify military intervention in support of the terrorists. On the other hand, we continue to fight the terrorists, because we know that the objective of all these American and Western allegations concerning chemical weapons is to support terrorists in Syria. That's why we will continue to fight these terrorists.

Question 2: But the Pentagon says that Syria has chemical weapons. Is it true that Syria has kept one percent of the weapons it has committed itself to hand over and destroy four years ago?

President Assad: You and I remember well what happened in 2003, when Colin Powell showed the world in the United Nations what he claimed to be the evidence which proves that President Saddam Hussein possessed chemical, nuclear, and other weapons. However, when the American forces invaded Iraq, it was proven that all he said was a lie. Powell himself admitted that the American intelligence agencies deceived him with that false evidence. That wasn't the first nor will it be the last time. This means that if you want to be a politician in the United States, you have to be a genuine liar. This is what characterizes American politicians: they lie on a daily basis, and say something and do something different. That's why we shouldn't believe what the Pentagon, or any other American institution says, because they say things which serve their policies, not things which reflect reality and the facts on the ground.

Question 3: What is the objective behind Syria's desire to acquire the latest generation of anti-missile systems from Russia?

President Assad: We are already in a state of war with Israel; and Israel has been committing aggressions on the Arab states surrounding it since its creation in 1948. So, it's natural that we should have such systems. However, the terrorists, acting on Israeli, American, Turkish, Qatari, and Saudi instructions have destroyed some of these systems. And it is natural for us to negotiate with the Russians now with a view to strengthening these systems, whether to face any Israeli threats from the air or the threats of American missiles. That has become a real possibility after the recent American aggression on al-Shairat airbase in Syria.

Question 4: What is the role that Israel, in particular, has played in this war against Syria? We know that Israeli attacks against the positions of the Syrian Arab Army have continued in recent weeks.

President Assad: It is playing this role in different forms; first, by direct aggression, particularly by using warplanes, artillery, or missiles against Syrian Army positions. Second, it is supporting terrorists in two ways: first by providing direct support in the form of weapons, and second by providing logistic support, i.e. allowing them to conduct military exercises in the areas it controls. It also provides them with medical assistance in its hospitals. These are not mere claims or assumptions. They are facts, verified and published on the internet which you can easily access as proven evidence of the Israeli role in support of the terrorists in Syria.

Question 5: How do you assess the current policy of Donald Trump in the world, and in Syria in particular?

President Assad: The American President has no policies. There are policies drawn by the American institutions which control the American regime which are the intelligence agencies, the Pentagon, the big arms and oil companies, and financial institutions, in addition to some other lobbies which influence American decision-making. The American President merely implements these policies, and the evidence is that when Trump tried to move on a different track, during and after his election campaign, he couldn't. He came under a ferocious attack. As we have seen in the past few week, he changed his rhetoric completely and subjected himself to the terms of the deep American state, or the deep American regime. That's why it is unrealistic and a complete waste of time to make an assessment of the American President's foreign policy, for he might say something; but he ultimately does what these institutions dictate to him. This is not new. This has been ongoing American policy for decades.

Question 6: The American administration has opened a new front now with North Korea. Is it possible that this will affect the current American approach towards Syria?

President Assad: No, the United States always seeks to control all the states of the world without exception. It does not accept allies, regardless of whether they are developed states as those in the Western bloc, or other states of the world. Every state should be an American satellite. That is why what is happening to Syria, to Korea, to Iran, to Russia, and maybe to Venezuela now, aims at re-imposing American hegemony on the world, because they believe that this hegemony is under threat now, which consequently threatens the interests of American economic and political elites.

Question 7: Russia's role in the Syrian conflict is very clear; but what is the role of China, this other great global power?

President Assad: There is great cooperation with Russia and China in terms of political action or political positions. Viewpoints are similar, and there is cooperation in the Security Council. As you know, the United States and its allies have tried several times to use the Security Council in order to legitimize the role of the terrorists in Syria and to legitimize their role in the illegitimate and aggressive intervention in Syria. That's why Russia and China stood together, and China's role, with the Russian role, was essential in this regard.

Moreover, some of the terrorists are Chinese nationals who came to Syria through Turkey. They pose a threat to us in Syria, but they pose an equal threat to China. China is aware of the fact that terrorism in any place in the world moves to any other place; and consequently, whether these terrorists are of Chinese or any other nationality, they might return to China and strike there as they have done in Europe, in Russia, and in Syria. We are now cooperating with China on security issues.

Question 8: Western and American media talk now about moderate terrorists and extremist terrorists. In reality, is there a difference between the two groups?

President Assad: For them, a moderate terrorist is that who carries out acts of beheading and slaughter but without carrying al-Qaeda flag, or without saying ""Allah Akbar,"" while an extremist terrorist is that who carries the flag and says Allah Akbar when carrying out acts of beheading and slaughter. This is the only difference. For the United States, all those who serve its political agenda against other states are classified as moderate opposition and not as extremist and terrorist, even if they commit the worst acts of terrorism. They are freedom fighters and not fighters in the cause of destruction and sabotage.

Question 9: There have been six years of war in Syria. What is Syria's position now, particularly in the absence of statistics about human losses?

President Assad: The most painful loss in any war is human loss, the suffering which is inflicted any family when it loses one of its members; for the whole family is scarred for life. This is the natural feeling in a region like ours, where family ties are very strong. Nothing compensates that loss, and nothing exceeds the pain it causes. There are of course huge economic and infrastructure losses, but this infrastructure has been built for a little over 50 years by Syrian hands, not foreign hands. And we have the capacity to rebuild this infrastructure. The same goes for the economy, for the Syrian economy is based on Syrian capabilities first and foremost; and our economic ties with the West have always been limited. When the war is over, it will all be rebuilt. We do not have a problem with that. It is true that it takes time, but it is not impossible. So, the greatest and most painful loss for Syria is the human loss.

Question 10: Of the 86 states constituting the alliance waging war on Syria, are there any that would take part in the process of reconstruction?

President Assad: No, of course not. First of all, they do not want to rebuild Syria, but some companies in those countries, if they see that the wheel of the economy and rebuilding has started to turn, and since they are opportunists, they are certainly prepared to come and have a share of rebuilding Syria in order to make money. The Syrian people will certainly not accept this. All the states which stood against the Syrian people and took part in the destruction and sabotage will never take part in rebuilding Syria. That is final.

Question 11: But how was life during these past six years in this besieged country?

President Assad: Life has certainly been tough to every Syrian citizen. The terrorists have destroyed the infrastructure. In certain areas, electricity is on for one or two hours, and there are areas in which there's no electricity at all. There are areas in which electricity has been cut off for more than two or three years. People don't know television, children do not go to school, there are no medical clinics or hospitals, and nobody treats the ill. They live a prehistoric existence thanks to the terrorists. There are areas which did not have water for years, like what happened in Aleppo, which did not have water for many long years. Sometimes, they use polluted water for drinking, washing up, and other purposes. Life has been very tough.

Question 12: One of the main targets during these years has been the person of Bashar al-Assad. Have you ever felt fear during these years?

President Assad: When you are in the middle of the war, you do not feel fear. I believe this is something common to all people. But you have a general concern for the homeland; for what is the value of being safe, as an individual, as a citizen, while the country is under threat? You cannot feel safe. I believe that the feeling we have in Syria in general is concern for the future of Syria rather than personal fear. The evidence is that mortar shells fall anywhere, on any house; nevertheless, you see that life continues in Syria. The will to life is much stronger than personal fear. As a President, I take strength from the feelings of the general public, not from my personal feelings. I do not live in isolation from the others.

Question 13: Western media have been waging a media campaign against you. Am I sitting now with this devil portrayed by the media?

President Assad: Yes, from a Western perspective, you are now sitting with the devil. This is how they market it in the West. But this is always the case when a state, a government, or an individual do not subjugate themselves to their interests, and do not work for their interests against the interests of their people. These have been the Western colonial demands throughout history. They say that this evil person is killing the good people. Okay, if he is killing the good people, who have been supporting him for the past six years? Neither Russia, nor Iran, nor any friendly state can support an individual at the expense of the people. This is impossible. If he is killing the people, how come the people support him? This is the contradictory Western narrative; and that's why we shouldn't waste our time on Western narratives because they have been full of lies throughout history, and not something new.

Question 14: What can Syria, too, do in order to put an end to this war ahead of the sixth round of Geneva talks?

President Assad: We said that there are two axes: the first is fighting the terrorists; and this is not subject to any discussion, and we don't have any other choice in dealing with the terrorists except fighting them. The other axis, the political one, includes two points: first, dialogue with the different political forces over the future of Syria; and second: local reconciliations, in the sense that we negotiate with the terrorists in a certain village or city, depending on each case separately. The objective of this reconciliation is for them to lay down their weapons and receive an amnesty from the state, and consequently return to their normal life. This approach has been implemented during the past three or four years, has succeeded, and is ongoing now. These are the axes which we can work on in order to find a solution to the Syrian crisis.

Question 15: From the perspective of a country in a state of war, how do you see the situation in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where a number of acts very similar to those which caused the conflict in Syria have emerged?

President Assad: Of course, they should be similar, because the party planning and implementing these acts is the same. It is the United States as a maestro and the Western states constituting the choir. Latin America in general, and Venezuela in particular, used to be the backyard of the United States for decades. Through that backyard, Western states, particularly North America, or the United States, used to secure their economic interests through the influence of the big companies in your countries. Military or political coups in Latin America during the 1960s and the 1970s aimed at perpetuating American hegemony over the interests of your people. But Latin America freed itself during the past twenty years and gained its independent decision-making. Governments started defending the interests of their peoples, which is unacceptable to the United States. That's why they are exploiting what's happening in the world, starting with the orange revolution in Ukraine up to the recent coup there a few years ago, and what is taking place in the Arab countries, in Libya, Syria, Yemen and others, in order to implement it in Latin America. They started in Venezuela with the objective of overthrowing the national government, and it will spread over to other Latin American countries.

Question 16: Some people, particularly ordinary citizens in Latin America, think that a scenario similar to what's happening in Syria could be repeated in Latin America. What do you think?

President Assad: This is true. That's why I say since the party planning and implementing is the same, it's natural that the scenario is not only similar, but identical. Some local elements might be different. In Syria, they said in the beginning that there were peaceful demonstrations, but in fact, when these peaceful demonstrations did not spread wide enough, they implanted individuals who fired on both sides, on the police and the demonstrations, and there were casualties. They started to say that the state is killing the people, and this scenario is being repeated everywhere. The same scenario will be repeated in Venezuela. That's why the Venezuelan people have to be very careful. There is a difference between opposing the government and being against the homeland, a huge difference. On the other hand, no foreign state can be more concerned about Venezuela's interests than the Venezuelan people themselves. Do not believe the West, for it's not concerned either about human rights or about the interests of states. It is only concerned about the interests of part of the governing elites in its countries. And these governing elites are not necessarily politicians, they are economic companies too.

Question 17: I'm talking about Latin America, Venezuela, the Bolivarian Revolution which was your strong ally. How do you remember the late Hugo Chavez?

President Assad: President Chavez was a world-class distinguished personality. When we talk about Latin America, we immediately remember the late President Chavez and the late leader Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. They are distinguished personalities who changed the face of Latin America. But of course the leader I knew personally and whom I met more than once and had a personal relationship with was President Chavez, when he visited us in Syria and I visited him in Venezuela. He visited us twice. When you meet him, you can tell that he is the son of the people. You do not feel that you are meeting a president or a politician, but a person who lived the suffering of his people. Everything he said, and every minute of his time, was about the details related to the people of his country. And when he talked with a head of another state, or an official from another state, he always thought of how to create common interests which reflect positively on his people. He was a real and strongly charismatic leader. And he was an extremely genuine person.

Question 18: They demonized Chavez before; and it is clear that it is Nicolas Maduro's turn now.

President Assad: Of course, as long as President Maduro is walking the same patriotic line, the line of Venezuela's independence, and acting in the best interest of his country's people, it is natural that he should be the first target of the United States. This is self-evident.

Question 19: How does Bashar al-Assad envision the end of the war?
President Assad: Today, foreign intervention in Syria aside, the problem is not complicated, for the majority of the Syrians are tired of the war and want a solution. They want to return to safety and stability. There is a dialogue between us as Syrians, there are meetings, and people live with each other, i.e. there is no real barrier. The problem now is that with every step we make towards a solution and regaining stability, the terrorist gangs receive more money and weapons in order to blow the situation up. That's why I can say that the solution should be stopping outside support to the terrorists. As far as we are concerned in Syria, reconciliation among all Syrians, and forgetting and forgiving all that happened in the past throughout this war, is the way to restore safety to Syria. Rest assured that Syria will be then much stronger than it was before the war.

Question 20: Are you prepared to have reconciliation with those who carried arms against the Syrian people?

President Assad: Of course, and this has actually happened in many and different places, and some of them have fought side by side with the Syrian Army, some fell martyrs, and some returned to their cities and live in the part under government control. We don't have a problem. Tolerance is essential to end any war. And we are proceeding on that track.

Question 21: Mr. President, what is your message to Latin America and the world?

President Assad: Keep your independence. We, in the Arab region, are celebrating independence in more than one country. But this independence used to mean, in a number of countries in the region, the mere evacuation of occupying forces. But real independence happens when you are in possession of your national decision-making. For us, Latin America was a model of independence, in the sense that occupiers were evacuated, in case there were foreign forces, but at the same time there was national decision-making, openness, and democracy. You provided the world with an important model. So, keep it, because if the countries of the third and developing world wanted to develop, they should follow the model implemented in Latin America.

Journalist: Mr. President, thank you for giving teleSUR this interview, and thank you for your precious time and all the information that you have provided.

President Assad: Thank you for coming, and once again I welcome you in Damascus.

Assad ha tracciato analogie tra gli eventi in Siria e il Venezuela

Lo scenario degli eventi in Venezuela, dove ci sono proteste di massa contro il governo, non a caso √® simile a quello in Siria, in quanto, in entrambi i casi, essi sono sostenuti dagli Stati Uniti, ha detto in un'intervista con il canale televisivo venezuelano Telesur il presidente siriano Bashar Assad.
""Certo, che sono simili, perch√© √® la loro parte nei piani e i risultati si vedono -. Lo stesso. Gli Stati Uniti sono il maestro e gli stati occidentali compongono il coro"", - ha detto il presidente siriano. Testo integrale dei risultati delle interviste nell'agenzia siriana Sana.
Secondo Assad i governi che in America Latina, negli ultimi decenni, difendevano gli interessi dei loro popoli, erano ""inaccettabili"" per gli Stati Uniti. 
""Ecco come usano, quello che sta succedendo nel mondo, dal momento della rivoluzione arancione in Ucraina, finita con il recente colpo di stato di pochi anni fa, e ci√≤ che sta accadendo nel mondo arabo, in Libia, Siria, Yemen, lo stanno applicando in America Latina"", - ha detto il leader siriano.
Le proteste continuano in Venezuela dal 4 aprile, dopo la decisione della Corte Suprema, di limitare severamente il potere d'opposizione dell'Assemblea nazionale. La decisione √® stata poi invertita, per√≤, i sostenitori dell'opposizione sono scesi in piazza chiedendo le dimissioni dei membri della corte e l'indizione di elezioni anticipate.

By Leith Fadel - 27/04/20170
The Syrian Foreign Ministry has condemned the remarks made by France's top diplomat, Jean-Marc Ayrault, about the alleged use of sarin gas in the Idlib province by the government forces.
The ministry said in a statement released by the SANA news agency on Thursday that ""fabricated allegations launched by French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault"" were part of the ""campaign of lies"" against Damascus.
According to the Syrian Foreign Ministry, these allegations show ""without any doubt the involvement of France in preparing this crime in the framework of its full partnership in the aggression on Syria.""
On Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that the samples obtained by the French intelligence services prove that sarin nerve gas had been used in Khan Sheikhoun (Idlib province). He blamed the forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the alleged chemical attack.
The alleged chemical incident in Khan Sheikhoun (Idlib province) occurred on April 4. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, on April 4, the Syrian air force delivered airstrikes on several militant facilities where munitions filled with poisonous substances were made.
However, Washington accused Damascus of using chemical weapons in the area, after which the US carried out a missile strike on a Syrian military airfield in the Homs province on April 7.

(traduzione testo nell'italiano sotto)

The jihadist rebels of Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham that are loyal to the Syrian opposition returned the corpses of five slain men from the ancient Christian town of Ma'aloula on Tuesday.

The five men, who the opposition has called ""Assad regime fighters,"" were executed by Jabhat Al-Nusra (now Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham) in the jihadist-controlled areas of Jaroud 'Arsal in Lebanon's Beqa'a Governorate.

Upon the return of the corpses, hundreds of civilians in Ma'aloula flooded the streets to pay tribute to their fallen men that were kidnapped by the Syrian opposition during the occupation of this ancient Christian town in 2013.

The Syrian opposition and their Gulf backers did not provide any reason as to why these men were executed; however, after a lengthy negotiation process, they agreed to return the bodies of these Ma'aloula residents.

L' ""opposizione"" terrorista siriana restituisce i cadaveri di 5 uomini uccisi dell'antica citt√† cristiana di Ma'aloula dopo 4 anni- i loro funerali ieri 25 04 2017 - VIDEO

I ribelli jihadisti di Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham che sono fedeli 
all ""opposizione"" terrorista siriana hanno riportato martedi i cadaveri di cinque uomini uccisi, dell'antica citt√† cristiana di Ma'aloula.

I cinque uomini, che i terroristi hanno chiamato ""combattenti del regime di Assad"", sono stati giustiziati da Jabhat Al-Nusra (ora Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham) nelle aree controllate dai jihadisti di Jaroud 'Arsal nel Libano, Beqa'a Governorate.

Al ritorno dei cadaveri, centinaia di civili a Ma'aloula hanno inondato le strade per rendere omaggio ai loro uomini caduti che sono stati rapiti dall'opposizione siriana durante l'occupazione di questa antica citt√† cristiana nel 2013.

L' ""opposizione"" terrorista siriana e i loro sostenitori del Golfo non hanno fornito alcuna ragione per il motivo per cui questi uomini sono stati giustiziati. Tuttavia, dopo un lungo processo di negoziazione, hanno accettato di restituire i corpi di questi residenti di #Maaloula.

Other Russian and Iranian soldiers in #Syria

Two news from yesterday ....
The first is that Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri urged the rebels, with a network-wide audio message, to implement a ""long-running guerrilla"" against #Bashar_al_Assad. For the jihadist leader, ""it will be a long-lasting war as it is backed by the West to stop Islamic expansion"", that ""the Sham (Levant) will not bend except Allah"" and, addressing the rebels, he added: ""You have to prepare for a long war with the crusaders and their Christian and Shiite allies. You have to go to the guerrilla strategy to bring them out of exhaustion. "" A change of course in the Al Qaeda strategy, therefore, that could create not only a few problems not only in Syria, but also in the West.

The second news relates to the possible sending of new Russian and Iranian troops to Syria, as Syria's sources told the Panarabo Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper.

Asked by #Damasco, #Mosca would send a formal request to President Assad to send more soldiers to those areas in Syria to continue pressing on the ""rebels"" -terrorists.
The same sources have also explained that Iran would also be preparing to play a more active role in the Syria war, including sending troops.

For #Theran and Moscow it is necessary to continue to support the government of Damascus in view of a political solution to the conflict. The Kremlin does not want to lose a key ally in the Middle East and above all, can not afford to lose the port of #Tartous, the only one overlooking the hot seas. Iran, on the other hand, must try to keep the so-called ""resistance axis"" united, in particular against Israel. For these reasons, #Iran and #Russia have for years sent their soldiers to fight alongside Damascus.

In the meantime, government forces have regained all missions lost in the Hama area and advanced in the #Damasco area, thanks to an impressive aerial coverage. For the first time after four years, Damascus troops have again taken control of the #Barzeh_Balad district and other areas in the hands of rebels in the east of the capital, as they managed yesterday to regain some areas in the northern part of the #Hama province.

Altri soldati russi e iraniani in #Siria
Due notizie da ieri.... 
La prima √® che il leader di Al Qaeda Ayman Al Zawahiri ha invitato i ribelli, con un messaggio audio diffuso in rete, ad attuare una ""guerriglia di lunga durata"" contro #Bashar_al_Assad. Per il leader jihadista, ""si tratter√† di una guerra di lunga durata in quanto √® sostenuta dall'Occidente per fermare l'espansione islamica"", che ""lo Sham (Levante) non si piegher√† se non ad Allah"" e, rivolgendosi ai ribelli, ha aggiunto: ""Dovete prepararvi ad una guerra lunga con i crociati e i loro alleati cristiani e sciiti. Dovete passare alla strategia della guerriglia per portarli all'esaurimento"". Un cambio di rotta nella strategia di Al Qaeda, quindi, che potrebbe creare non pochi problemi non solo alla Siria, ma anche all'Occidente.
La seconda notizia riguarda invece il possibile invio di nuove truppe russe e iraniane in #Siria, come hanno riferito fonti dell'esercito siriano al giornale panarabo Al-Quds Al-Arabi.
Secondo quanto fa sapere #Damasco, #Mosca avrebbe inviato una richiesta formale al presidente #Assad per poter inviare altri soldati in quelle zone della Siria necessarie per continuare a far pressione sui ""ribelli""-terroristi. 
Le stesse fonti hanno anche spiegato che pure l'Iran si starebbe preparando ad avere un ruolo pi√π attivo nella guerra in Siria, anche con l'invio di truppe di terra.
Per #Teheran e Mosca √® infatti necessario continuare ad apoggiare il governo di Damasco in vista di una soluzione politica del conflitto. Il Cremlino non vuole perdere un alleato chiave nello scacchiere mediorientale e, soprattutto, non pu√≤ permettersi di perdere il porto di #Tartous, l'unico affacciato sui mari caldi. L'Iran invece deve cercare di mantenere unito il cosiddetto ""asse della resistenza"" per contrapporsi soprattutto ad #Israele. Per questi motivi Iran e Russia da anni inviano i propri soldati a combattere al fianco di Damasco.
Le forze governative, nel frattempo, hanno riconquistato tutte postazioni perse nella zona di Hama e avanzato nell'area di #Damasco, grazie anche ad una imponente copertura aerea. Per la prima volta dopo quattro anni invece le truppe di Damasco hanno ripreso il controllo del quartiere #Barzeh_Balad e altre zone prima in mano ai ribelli della zona est della capitale, cos√¨ come sono riuscite ieri a riconquistare alcune zone della parte settentrionale della provincia di #Hama.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1567484979936476/?type=3,2017-04-25 19:29:27,31,0,7,31,0,0,0,0,0

782503618434620_1567268416624799,"Why Israel Supports Rebels in Syria

I have written in the past on Israel's support for rebels in Syria. In light of the recent intensification in Syria, perhaps it is time to explain why.

It is not a pleasant sight to see Israel aiding bearded fanatics who seek to topple the secular and brutal regime of Assad, especially when Israel battles the same Islamic radicals in Gaza or the West Bank. But for Israel support for rebels is a matter of survival and is qualitatively different from the interests of the United States, Russia or Turkey.

Syrian President Assad has been the main supplier of weapons to Hezbollah, the Shiite guerrilla organization in South Lebanon, which has been battling ISIS in Syria. Hezbollah was founded after Israel's invasion of South Lebanon which was itself proceeded by PLO's firing of missiles into northern Israel. In an attempt to establish security for the residents in northern Israel, it engaged in an 18 years long occupation of a buffer zone in South Lebanon, and thereby sought to push off terrorists who were launching missiles into civilian populations further away.
But while Israeli soldiers in 1982 were initially greeted as saviors by Lebanese Shiites, over time Hezbollah, an organization supported by Iran and led by Shiite clerics, developed as a response to Israel's occupation of the region and engaged in very effective guerrilla operations against the Israeli army that eventually forced the latter's withdrawal in 24 May 2000.

Now Hezbollah contains a vast missile arsenal which has a potential to hit as far as southern Israel. In the two recent wars Israel waged with Hezbollah both sides suffered significant losses.
In earlier occasions Hezbollah's missiles hit Haifa in the north, causing vast civilian deaths. Israel has bombarded Lebanon heavily during past conflicts.
Despite Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon, Hezbollah still sees itself as a liberation force meant to conquer the whole of Israel. Supported by Iran, which supports the de facto ethnic cleansing of Israel from its Jewish residents ‚Äì at least those who has returned to the Holy Land in the past 100 years ‚Äì Hezbollah sees itself as the spearhead of the Islamic world's war against Israel.

So, Israel is faced with two realistic choices: allow Hezbollah to prosper and attack it, or destabilize Syria so as to cut off Hezbollah from Syria and prevent the flow of arms. True, turning Syria into a base of Sunni radicals is not a very rosy picture, but understandably from Israel's perspective, the Sunni fanatics pose a lesser threat than Hezbollah. They are less organized and less capable, and at least a decade may pass before they can attack Israel successfully, if ever.

The United States would like to see Assad removed due to allegations of committing acts of genocide against his own people, and also since he is an independent non-western political force. Assad is de factor the protector of minorities in Syria, including Christians and the few Jews who still live there. If Syria is turned over to ISIS and Assad is removed, Syria is likely to turn into one large al Qaeda type based from which attacks could be launched throughout Europe and elsewhere.  Russia would like Assad to remain since Syria is its ally, and since it fears it will be the next target if terrorists in Syria have their way, as Libya ended up as a disaster. Turkey would like to bring down the Kurds and have influence in Syria, and therefore it prefers it will be governed by Islamists.

But for all the countries above, radical Sunni elements or Hezbollah do not pose a threat as immediate as the one posed by Hezbollah to Israel.  At the same time, it should be obvious that the threat the jihadists in Syria pose to the Syrian government is far greater than the threat posed by Hezbollah to Israel.
Israel has been the punching bag of many western leftists and academics. But Israel's support for regime change in Syria is understandable, considering the fact that Hezbollah has the capacity to attack its cities with advanced missiles and is an ideological-religious organization bent on its destruction.
Russia and Iran may dislike Israel's support for regime change in Syria, and Putin attacked Netanyahu for speaking against Assad, but if Russia and Iran were serious about solving the Syrian conundrum, they should have pushed Hezbollah to recognize Israel. Of course, Iran is not about to do that but Russia could have and did not.

Feeble and gullible conspiracy theorists believe Israel is supporting jihadists in Syria since it wants to expand into Syria. But they cannot respond rationally to the questions on why Israel would want to annex Sunni areas in Syria when it can't even bring itself to annex the West Bank, why did it withdraw from South Lebanon if expansion was always the plan, and ‚Äì if it is bent on expanding ‚Äì why did it give to Egypt the entire Sinai, which was twice the size of Israel in 1978?).
However, Israel's support for radicals in Syria has its risks. Granted, Israel is now playing the imperial tactic of Divide and Conquer, decades after it opposed British colonialism in Palestine and successfully liberated the country. Such tactics tend to backfire eventually, though Korea, Pakistan-India, Israel-Palestine still suffer from the open wounds of successful British designs.
The war in Syria will likely intensify and may lead to a third world war and it's probably too late for dialogue or change. But Israel's support for Islamic rebels in Syria, whether through medical aid alone or by other means, makes sense from its survival instincts.

Former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said he had received excuses from ISIS terrorists for failing to attack Israel's positions at the #Golan heights.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, revealed in an interview last week on Israeli television channel Canale10 that the ISIS terrorist group (Daesh, in Arabic) attacked the Israeli army in the Syrian #Golan Heights, occupied by the regime of #Tel_Aviv.
 
However, he continued, the terrorists argued that this was a mistake and that the attack was not aimed at Israeli stations, and therefore, as Yaalon pointed out, ISIS apologized immediately.
 
By avoiding clarifying the exact date of the ISIS attack, Yaalon denounced the attacks launched by Syrian soil against Israeli stations on the Golan Heights.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1566260043392303/?type=3,2017-04-24 18:45:22,20,1,7,19,0,1,0,0,0

Jazeri told reporters in Tehran that the incitement of wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Afghanistan was the result of unacceptable interference by Western states and their agents in the Middle East. However, the successes of the Lebanese resistance and the successive victories of the Syrian army indicate the inevitability of the final victory of the peoples of the region over neocolonialism.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Il Vice Capo dello Stato Maggiore delle Forze Armate dell'Iran, Masud Jazzari, ha confermato che le guerre, l'insicurezza e l'emergere di organizzazioni terroristiche takfiristiche nella regione sono un risultato diretto delle politiche dei paesi occidentali e dei loro complici.
Jazzari ha detto ai giornalisti a Teheran che l'istigazione di guerre in Yemen, Iraq, Siria, Libano, Palestina e Afghanistan √® stato il risultato di un'interferenza inaccettabile dei paesi occidentali e dei loro agenti in Medio Oriente. Tuttavia, il successo della resistenza libanese e le vittorie consecutive dell'esercito siriano indicano l'inevitabilit√† della vittoria finale dei popoli della regione sul neocolonialismo.

yrian President Bashar Assad told Sputnik in an interview that he is not ruling out Russian ground troops' assistance in case the number of terrorists from around the world rises in Syria.

DAMASCUS (Sputnik) ‚Äî Syria could require Russian military assistance on the ground if terrorists change course and recruit more fighters from abroad, Assad told Sputnik.

""Maybe in the future if our enemies and their supporters, their terrorists, the proxies, change their strategy and bring more terrorists from around the world, and you have full armies of terrorists at that time, it could be needed,"" Assad said.

He praised the Russian Aerospace Forces' efficiency in assisting the Syrian military, saying ""everybody knows that since that support started in 2015, the balance has changed, and we could recapture Palmyra and Aleppo and many other areas.""

""So, I don't think now there is a need for ground troops,"" Assad said, noting that Russian air- and sea-based missiles from facilities in the northeast and the Mediterranean provide additional support.

Russia's air group at the Hmeymim airbase in northwestern Syria is protected by the S-400 and S-300 air defense systems, as well as the Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile launchers. The S-400 and Pantsir systems provides air cover to the Russian aviation grouping at Hmeymim, while the S-300s protects Russia's naval facility in Tartus.
The S-400 system was deployed at the Hmeymim following the Turkish Air Force's November 2015 downing of a Russian Su-24 bomber on the Syrian-Turkish border. In October 2016, the Russian Defense Ministry said that a S-300 system was sent to Syria to ensure the safety of the Russian naval base in Tartus. According to media reports, the system deployed in Syria is S-300V4 ‚Äî NATO designation SA-23 Gladiator ‚Äî that is capable of striking tactical and strategic aircraft, medium-range ballistic missiles, tactical missiles as well as cruise missiles.

Russia began airstrikes against terrorists' targets in Syria on September 30, 2015, following a request from Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Sir(devil) Evelyn de Rothschild has urged western nations to ""unite as one"" in order to ""intervene"" in #Syria and overthrow #Assad to ""usher Syrians into the new century.""

Describing Assad as ""a brutal dictator who must be bought to heel"" during a grim speech at a fundraiser in the City of London financial district, Rothschild demanded that western nations ""topple the Assad regime"" because it is ""resistant to common decency"" and a threat to our ""corporate values.""

Rothschild also referred to his family businesses which originated with five brothers setting up the ""first and only truly global banking system,"" operating from London, Paris, Vienna, Naples and Frankfurt just before the turn of the 19th century.

He said: ""These five brothers, working together to exchange information and ideas, built an extraordinary business that superseded boundaries and cultures.

""Just over 200 years later, these business ideals, which have stood the test of time, are now under threat by despotic regimes that are resistant to common decency. These regimes pose a threat to our international corporate values.""

Sir Evelyn, a billionaire financier who is married to Lynn Forester de Rothschild, did not explain why world governments should listen to his demands for interventionist wars in the Middle-East.

However it has been suggested he is advocating for the invasion of Syria because the nation remains one of only five nations left in the world that does not have a Rothschild controlled central bank.

In the year 2000 there were eight countries without a Rothschild controlled central bank, however Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan ‚Äì immediately after western invasion ‚Äì now all have established central banks.

Will Syria be next?

782503618434620_1562346863783621,"President Assad's Interview with RIA Novosti & Sputnik 21 04 2017

President al-Assad : Khan Sheikhoun incident fabricated..The West and the US blocked the investigation because it will find that all their allegations and narratives were lies.

President Bashar al-Assad stressed that what has been said on Khan Sheikhoun is  a fabricated story, adding that the West and the United States blocked any delegation from coming to investigate, because if they come, they will find that all their narratives about what happened in Khan Sheikhoun and then the attack on Shairat airport was a false flag, was a lie.

In an interview given to Russia's RIA Novosti and Sputnik news agencies, President al-Assad said that we always announce that we are ready to cooperate with any country who is genuinely ready or wants or has the will to fight terrorism.

He added that we already know that the West supports the terrorists and it doesn't have a will to fight them.

Following is the full text of the interview:

Question 1: Thank you, Mr. President, for giving an opportunity for this interview, and I will start with the recent tragic event in Aleppo, where the majority of those killed and wounded were children. Who do you think organized this crime, and on what purpose?

President Assad: A few months ago, the same agreement was about to be implemented, but as you know, you're talking about different factions, all of them are linked to Al Qaeda or al-Nusra Front, and one of those factions attacked the buses that wanted to transport the same civilians outside of al-Foua'a and Kefraya beside Aleppo, and they attacked those buses and they burned them, and it was shown on the internet, where they said ""we won't allow this reconciliation to happen, we're going to kill every civilian that wants to use the buses,"" and that's what happened. When we thought that everything is ready to implement that reconciliation, they did what they announced, and they are al-Nusra Front, they didn't hide themselves from the very beginning, and I think everybody agrees that this is al-Nusra.

Question 2: Any specific group or al-Nusra itself?

President Assad: No, because when you talk about al-Nusra, it's their ideology, so different names ‚Äì and as you know al-Nusra itself changed its name ‚Äì so different names doesn't mean changing the ideology or the behavior or the course of killing. So, it doesn't matter what's the name.

Question 3: And how many people have died since the beginning of the war, at this point?

President Assad: Actually, we can talk only about official numbers. It's tens of thousands, not like what you hear in the media about hundreds of thousands. Of course, we can talk about thousands of missing people that we don't know anything about their fate. This is the official number. But in the West, of course they add altogether the number of the terrorists, and a large amount of the terrorists of course they're not registered at the state as killed or dead, and the same thing about the foreigners who came to Syria in tens or maybe hundreds of thousands to fight. So, the numbers that we've been hearing in the Western media during the last six years were not precise, it's only to inflate the number just to show how horrible the situation, to use it as humanitarian pretext to intervene in Syria. So, as a state, we only talk about tens of thousands of victims till this moment.

Question 4: So, you're not agreeing with the number that the United Nations give?

President Assad: No, because the United Nations doesn't have any means to calculate the numbers, and actually no-one has, as I said, because you're talking about different factions; foreigners, Syrians and terrorists and so on, so it's complicated to tell. The only thing that we have are the official records. Of course, it must be higher than the official record, but we cannot just estimate and give any number.

Question 5: I see. Yesterday, there were reports that al-Baghdadi was captured by the Russian and Syrian military at the border of Syria and Iraq. Can you confirm it?

President Assad: No, no. That's not true.

Journalist: That's not true?

President Assad: No, no. That's not true. Anyway, those borders are under the control of ISIS till this moment., it's neither Syrian nor Russian, not even Western or American or any other one; it's only ISIS who's controlling those borders, so it's safe for al-Baghdadi to be in that area.

Question 6: Let's talk a little bit about this missile strike from the United States. So, the Shairat airbase quickly returned to its operation, but many wondered why the Syrian Army didn't hit the US missiles, didn't try to down it, why?

President Assad: Many people wonder about whether our air defense or the Russian air defense and they look at it as absolute power that can take down any missile. Technically, it's complicated, because the missile must see its target, let's say, our missile, and to see it you need a radar that can see every angle of the country which is impossible because you're talking about terrain and topography, and as you know the cruise missiles use those terrain in order to hide from the radar, so it needs an intensive system to see every angle, in that way you can take it down. This is one.
Second, maybe a few people knew that the terrorists at the very beginning of the attacks, they started by destroying the Syrian air defense, which has nothing to do with what they called it that time the ""peaceful demonstrations."" Most of the air defense are outside the cities in outlying areas, so they started attacking that air defense and it was affected dramatically during the crisis. So, you have many factors that could influence taking down those missiles.

Question 7: So, how many items from the air defense system you lost during these attacks by terrorists before the US launched its attack?

President Assad: A huge number, a huge number. It was the first target. The first target was the air defense. We don't have to give a precise number now, because as you know it's military information, but I can tell you more than fifty percent. Of course, the Russians, through their support to the Syrian Army, they compensated part of that loss with quality armaments and air defense systems, but this is not enough when you talk about a full country. It takes a long time to recover all your air defense.

Question 8: Are there any concrete negotiations underway with the Russians regarding the purchasing of new air defense systems?

President Assad: Yes, it's always the case, before the war and during the war. Of course, we need more armaments after the war and because of the consumption, and this is part of the daily relation between the two institutions in the Ministry of Defense in Russia and Syria.

Question 9: What kind of systems are you interested in now after the attack, like S-300, S-400, or what kind of system?

President Assad: Usually we're always interested in the last generation of any system, but that depends on what's available, that depends on the policy of the vendor, which is Russia, and that depends on the prices. You have many criteria and that depends of course on the specifications that you're looking for that could be suitable to your kind of war, to your army, to your terrain, to many other criteria that's related to the air defense.

Question 10: Has there been any talks of possible non-repayable deliveries, delivery for free from Russia, or is it a commercial contract?

President Assad: In this situation, I mean our war, Russia looks at this war as more than Syrian war, and more than Syrian-Russian war. I think it's the war of every country that wants to protect its citizens from the terrorists. So, when Russia supports our army, it not only protects the Syrian citizens, it also protects the Russian citizens, and I think the European and others. So, for them they don't look at it as commercial war like the Americans; when they launch a war they calculated how much jobs can you create out of this war. They look at it as a war that needs to protect their citizens, our citizens, other citizens, the position of Russia, the balance, the political balance, the military balance around the world, as a great country. So, in that regard, you don't look at the armaments as how much do they cost or how much do they bring as benefit or profit.

Question 11: Alright. So, Damascus has said that it is ready for the mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to come and to investigate the Khan Sheikhoun incident. Have there been any contacts between you and this organization, and what are the possible dates for the arrival of the first team of experts?

President Assad: Actually, since the first attack a few years ago that happened in Aleppo by the terrorists against our army, we asked the United Nations to send investigation delegation in order to prove what we said about the terrorists having gases used against our army, and later many incidents happened in that way, and they didn't send any delegation. It's the same now. We formally sent a letter to the United Nations, we asked them in that letter to send a delegation in order to investigate what happened in Khan Sheikhoun. Of course till this moment they didn't send, because the West and the United States blocked any delegation from coming, because if they come, they will find that all their narratives about what happened in Khan Sheikhoun and then the attack on Shairat airport was a false flag, was a lie. That's why they didn't send. Now the only contact I think is between Russia and maybe the other countries in order to send that delegation. Till this moment, we didn't have any positive news regarding any delegation coming.

Question 12: What is your view of what happened there? Because there were a lot of different reports of different kinds, and misinterpretation and accusation of fake news. So, what happened there according to your information?

President Assad: Actually, that area is under the control of al-Nusra Front which is Al Qaeda. The only information the whole world has is what this organization or this group ‚Äì which is al-Nusra ‚Äì published on YouTube, on the internet in general, and in different outlets, mainly Western outlets, so we cannot base our judgment on their reports. First of all, we don't know if the site that we attacked that day half an hour before noon, about 11:30, was a chemical warehouse or depot or anything like this. And their story said that the attack happened at 6, 6:30 in the morning. We didn't launch any attack at that time. So, you have two possibilities: the first one is that there was an attack at lunch time or at about 11:30. The other possibility that we believe in is that it was a false flag, there was no attack, all what we saw as pictures and videos was like the videos we've been seeing for the last year or two years or more regarding the White Helmets, the humanitarian Al Qaeda which is an elusive story, let's say, it doesn't exist anyway, and the picture that shows children being killed by Russian airstrike to discover later that it wasn't a real picture, they put a boy, they covered him with mud and blood, fake blood of course, and so on. All these ploys could be part of them. That's what we believe in, because the attack was already prepared, and they didn't want to listen, they didn't want to investigate; they only wanted to launch the attack. We believe it was a false flag for one reason and a simple reason: if there was gas leakage or attack, and you're talking about 60 dead in that city, how could the city continue its life normally? They didn't evacuate the city. No-one left the city, life continued as normal, and this is mass destruction. The other day, they attacked Shairat where they said there was the gas depots, and they attacked all the depots, and there was no gas coming out of that airport. No-one of our army officers or military staff, was affected by any gas. So, for us, there was no gas attack and no gas depot, it was a false flag play just to justify the attack on the Shairat base. That's what happened.

Question 13: So, the main version is that no chemical weapons or no chemicals were used there?

President Assad: No, I mean even if you look at the pictures, you can see that the rescuers ‚Äì presumable rescuers ‚Äì were rescuing people without masks, without gloves, and they were moving freely. How? This is against all the specifications of the sarin gas that they talked about. They cannot, they would have been dead like the others, and you don't know that those people who are lying on the ground were dead or not. You can fake this image, it's very easy. So, you cannot just base your judgment on images and videos, especially made by Al Qaeda.

Question 14: And what about possible future provocations like that, because our President Putin has said that there's information that such kind of provocations could happen in the future. What is your assessment of this possibility?

President Assad: Actually, this possibility is not only because of what happened recently. It happened before, and we had this possibility a few years ago, since the first time they used it in 2013, since that time it's a possibility for us, and it's been used, it wasn't only a possibility, but this time the propaganda was different, because everybody was ready for the attack, so that was part of the agenda, part of the plan, it was one plan, it wasn't two different incidents. So, of course it is a possibility. This is first, I mean because it happened before.
Second, because the regime in the United States hasn't changed. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has been attacking different countries in different ways without taking into consideration the Security Council or the United Nations. So, the deep regime hasn't changed, the deep regime is the same that go and attack and kill and tell lies in order to justify what you are doing or what you have been doing. So, nothing has changed regarding the United States. They can do it any time, they can do something different, because their aim is to destabilize Syria, their aim is to change the government, to topple the government, and to bring their puppets instead, so they will do everything, for them the end justifies the means, no values, no morals at all, anything could happen.

Question 15: And is there a threat of using of chemical weapons by the terrorists? And if so, from where do they get it? From which countries?

President Assad: From Turkey. Directly from Turkey, and there was evidences regarding this, some of them have been shown on the internet a few years ago. You had many parties and parliament members in Turkey who questioned the government regarding those allegations. So, it's not something hidden. Many in Syria knew that, and the only way, the only route for the terrorists to get money, armaments, every logistic support, recruits, and this kind of material, is through Turkey, they don't have any other way to come from the north. So, it's a hundred percent Turkey.

Question 16: Let's go to another point about the military situation. When will the Syrian Army start an operation to liberate Raqqa, and will the Kurdish units be involved, and will Russians be involved, and is there a possibility of cooperation with the Western coalition and Iraqi forces?

President Assad: Regarding fighting terrorism, we always announce that we are ready to cooperate with any country who is genuinely ready or wants or has the will to fight terrorism. We didn't even define which countries; any country including the West, taking into consideration that we already know that the West supports the terrorists and it doesn't have a will to fight them. But we said whoever is ready, we are ready. Regarding the Syrian-Russian cooperation and talking about the Kurds, we always talk with different factions in Syria who are fighting the terrorists, and we had direct contact with the Kurds, and of course with the Russians regarding this. The question on how, you know that only a month ago our army was advancing from Aleppo towards the east, toward Raqqa, it wasn't far from reaching Raqqa, and this is when the terrorists launched their attack against the middle of Syria, against the city of Hama, in order to protect ISIS in two areas: the eastern area is Hama, which is close to Palmyra after we liberated Palmyra recently, in order to slow the advance of the Syrian Army in that direction. The second one is toward Raqqa for the same objective. And actually because of that attack on Hama we had to slow down our attack ‚Äì not stop it, to slow down ‚Äì because part of the troops, Syrian Arab Army troops, in both directions have to come south and west to Hama in order to defend the city, and of course they repelled the attack and they succeeded, but at the expense of advancing in different areas. So, that will tell you about the relation between ISIS and al-Nusra, and the relation between ISIS and al-Nusra and Turkey, and of course Turkey means the United States, and the United States means France and the UK, and both mean Saudi Arabia, and so on. So, this is one choir actually, and they have one army, one proxy army, which is different factions, mainly Al Qaeda, mainly al-Nusra and ISIS. So, that's why our advancement toward Raqqa has been slowed down, because we changed the priority because of different fronts of the terrorists.

Question 17: I see. And regarding Turkey, you've mentioned, so in the north of Aleppo, in al-Bab, the Syrian Army is facing Turkey forces that have invaded Syria in breach of international law. Will the Syrian Army undertake any action to put an end to this Turkish intervention, and so when and how this could take place?

President Assad: When you talk about the Turkish invasion, when you talk about the American troops ‚Äì again, it's an invasion ‚Äì and when you talk about the terrorists on the ground, it's one entity, there's no difference. There's one master who's controlling all these factions. So, the priority now is to defeat the terrorists. When you defeat the terrorists, the Turkish army and any other army will be weak on the ground. Their real strength are their proxies, not their own army. In that regard, when you defeat the terrorists in different areas, it's going to be very easy to expel any other one including the Turks; either they leave, or it's your land, you have to defend it, you have to go and fight, you can't say ""they can stay"" or ""let's negotiate."" No, you don't negotiate; it's your land, you defend it, you expel them, you fight them. But the priority now is to fight their proxies, because they are the strongest element on the ground.

Question 18: And do you expect military escalation after the US missile strike, and can this result lead to direct confrontation between Syria and the United States?

President Assad: Actually, as you know, they attacked the airbase from the Mediterranean, so you're talking about hundreds of miles, sometimes thousands of miles away, which is out of our reach as Syrian Army. So, if we want to be realistic, we can say we don't reach their ships in the Mediterranean, but if you talk about the troops on the ground, again, the same like the Turkish issue, when you defeat their terrorists ‚Äì because the terrorists are their terrorists ‚Äì this is where you can go and fight others who occupy the land. In that regard, the Americans, like the Turks, like any other occupiers, they have to get out by their will or by force.

Question 19: Do you think that there can be an improvement in the bilateral relations between Syria and the United States?

President Assad: We always try to look at the full half of the cup, but we couldn't find it. We tried to see anything positive, we said that what this president, Trump, what he said, we said ""promising,"" I described it as promising, a few months ago. But actually, it's not about what they promise, because we all know that the American officials say something and do something different, they're never committed to their promises or their words. So, that's what have been proven recently after the attack on Shairat; they say something and they do something different. So, in politics you don't say ""I wouldn't do this."" Whenever there is a window of hope that this state or this regime can change its attitude toward respecting your sovereignty, toward more preventing of any blood-letting in your country, you have to cooperate. It's not a personal relation, it's not hate and love; it's the interest of your own people. So, I cannot say this escalation has changed anything, because this escalation is the real expression of the reality of the American regime that's been there for decades, it's not new for the United States to do such a thing, but you need to deal with the United States as a great country, at least to make it refrain from any harmful effects, generally, I'm not talking only about Syria. When they change their behavior, we are ready, we don't have a problem.

Question 20: Have you tried to establish any contacts, or do you plan to have contacts with representatives of the Trump administration?

President Assad: Not really, we don't have any channel now between Syria and the United States regime or administration, we don't have.

Question 21: Okay, and how do you assess the emerging coalition between the United States and Kurdish units? Have you taken steps to prevent the establishment of self-ruling region in the north of the country?

President Assad: We don't have control in that area, in the meantime, but talking about self-control or confederation or anything like this, when you don't have war, when you have a normal situation, it's going to be related to the constitution, because Syria is a melting pot of different cultures, different ethnicities, religions, sects, and so on. So, not a single part of this social fabric can define the future of Syria; it needs consensus. So, regarding what you mentioned, it's better to wait to discuss the next constitution between the different Syrian shades of our spectrum, let's say, and this is where we can tell how's it going to be there. Our impression today is that the majority, the vast majority of Syrians, never believe in self-governance or confederation or anything. In this time, it's being used as an excuse because there's no government in that area. They say ""we are governing ourselves because there is no government."" It's an excuse for today, but when you have stability and the government taking control of the country, of course there's no excuse to deal with such a situation unless there's a constitution that allows a certain area to have its confederation or federation or any other way of governance.

Question 22: And regarding the constitution, have you already started the project that is now debated in Geneva, and what do you think about the proposal of withdrawing the word ""Arab"" from the name of the country?

President Assad: Again, as a government, we don't own the constitution; it should a Syrian consensus. If the Syrians don't believe in the word of ""Arab state,"" what's the meaning of having this word? Just because the government believes? No, we have to be the mirror of the majority of the Syrians, when we say yes or no. Our impression is that the majority of the Syrians, they adhere to this word, because this is their identity, the majority of Syrians are Arabs, and they believe in their identity. But again, I wouldn't say that this is right or wrong till the Syrians have their own say in a referendum, before saying the President said he supports this word or he's against that word. It means nothing in the meantime. It's still early to discuss that point, it's not a contention issue, I mean, nobody is discussing it now. A few people in Syria, mainly among the Kurds, mention this issue. It's not a big problem.

Question 23: And what is the most contentious issue, according to you?

President Assad: To the constitution?

Journalist: To the constitution, yes.

President Assad: Being secular. Most of the factions that apparently joined the negotiations in Astana and part of them in Geneva, they don't accept a secular state, they want it a religious state, Islamic state. This is the most important part of, could be, the disagreement regarding the constitution. Of course till this moment we haven't started direct negotiations, but we know through the mediators what they propose, and what we propose.

Question 24: So, we just talked about the situation in the north, and something is happening there down in the south. So, do you have any information about Jordan's plans to deploy its troops in Syria in coordination with the United States under the pretext of fighting ISIS? Certain media reported. And if this is the case, do you think that there is a threat from the neighboring countries to dismember Syria?
President Assad: We have those information, not only through the media, through the different sources, because you know we have the same tribes, the same families living on both sides of the borders, so they can see any changes in the mood or in the logistics, any new plans of the army you can see it on the ground. So, we have such information, but anyway Jordan was part of the American plan since the beginning of the war in Syria. Whether he likes it or not, he has to obey the orders of the Americans. Jordan is not an independent country anyway, whatever the American wants, it will happen, so if the Americans want to use the northern part of Jordan against Syria, they're going to use it, so it's not about Jordan, we don't discuss Jordan as a state; we discuss Jordan as land in that case, because it's the United States who defines the plans, who defines the players, and who endorses everything regarding Syria coming from Jordan, and many of the terrorists coming from Jordan, and of course Turkey, since day one of the war in Syria.

Question 25: Let's talk a little bit about the situation in Mosul. What is your estimate of the number of ISIS militants pushed out of the Mosul region into the Syrian territory? And to what extent did the coalition's operation in Mosul and the withdrawal of terrorists strengthen the positions of ISIS here in Syria? Could this, for instance, lead to the full terrorist control over Deir Ezzor?

President Assad: If we want to link different events with each other, we can have the answer. First of all, no-one has a precise number of ISIS coming to Syria because it's a free border now; you don't have regular borders, you don't have Syrian Army, you don't have police, you have no state there. So, no-one can tell you, but the estimation from the information that we have from the citizens in those areas, they talk about tens of thousands of fighters of ISIS coming to Syria. If you go back a few months ago when the alliance airplanes attacked our military site beside Deir Ezzor, they attacked one of the major sites, it's a mountain called Thurda, which is a strategic mountain to protect Deir Ezzor from being in the hands of ISIS. They attacked our army for more than one hour, and they killed tens of our soldiers, and they said ""sorry, it was a mistake,"" although it is a big mountain, a huge mountain; you cannot make a mistake, it's not a building. Then later, they started allowing the fighters coming from Mosul. Of course, they wanted to do a two-aspect operation. The first aspect is that the United States is attacking ISIS in Mosul, they are against ISIS, but at the same time, they are supporting ISIS and they allow them to cross the border from Iraq into Syria. It means they helped ISIS to come to Deir Ezzor and to undermine the Syrian Army who are defending Deir Ezzor. They wanted Deir Ezoor to fall into the hands of ISIS and maybe later in one of their plays like what happened in Jarablus, in Ein al-Arab, in different areas, they will make negotiations with ISIS to leave Deir Ezzor and to say that they liberated Deir Ezzor to send their proxies and puppets to attack them. Fortunately, the Syrian Army was resilient and strong enough to repel ISIS after the alliance attack a few months ago. Now, it's advancing slowly, recapturing the area from ISIS slowly, but the situation today is better than yesterday and better than a week ago, and so on. So, your question is a hundred percent correct. That's an American plan, and they allow them and they give them the cover to come to Syria.

Question 26: So, it changes the situation, the military situation as you said, the threats from the north, from the Iraqi part of the borders, from Jordan, and the military missile attack from US ships. In this situation, are you going to ask Russia for more help to enhance the Russian assistance, including probably on the ground?

President Assad: Actually, the Russian air forces were very effective and efficient during the last year and a half, little bit more, in supporting the Syrian Army, and everybody knows that since that support started in 2015, the balance has changed, and we could recapture Palmyra and Aleppo and many other areas, and we could defend Hama recently; it was a very huge and well-organized attack, but we could repel it. So, that support was very efficient, and of course, we shouldn't forget the efficient support of the Iranians on the ground; they did not send troops, but with their officers, with their advisors, they played a very important role. So, I don't think now there is a need for ground troops. Sometimes when there is intense attack on different fronts, as you mentioned, north, east, south, and in the middle, the Russian missiles attack from the sea. The Russian strategic bomber came from Russia to attack in Syria. So, the military support, the Russian military support is not limited to their base in Syria. Actually, they are aware about what the need of the fight; you have this fluctuation, but you don't need troops on the ground till that moment. Maybe in the future if our enemies and their supporters, their terrorists, the proxies, change their strategy and bring more terrorists from around the world, and you have full armies of terrorists at that time, it could be needed, but at this moment, I don't think it's needed. What's been done is good and enough.

Question 27: Regarding the future of the political settlement, how do you see it, taking into account the low effectiveness of the Geneva talks? And can Astana replace Geneva as a main platform for negotiations? And another question: are there any people with whom you are ready to contact, to engage in direct talks from the opposition side, I mean from those who come to Astana, from the military factions, or in Geneva?

President Assad: First of all, our estimation of Geneva is that it hasn't started yet; till this moment, nothing, it's a still-born, it's dead, because, I mean if you want to buy utility in the market, the first you read on the box is the requirement, what's the requirement for this utility to work properly, to deliver what you expect? The same for anything in this world. If you are talking about Geneva, it could be a good idea. Astana is a very good idea, but do we have the requirement for these two means to produce? Till the moment, no, because part of this event which is Russia, Iran, and of course Syria, they are willing to achieve a peaceful solution. They respect the sovereignty of Syria, they're looking for the unity of Syria, they respect the Charter of the United Nations, the different Security Council resolutions, and so on, while if you look at the other party, the Western bloc with their allies in the region and their proxies, of course, they are in the other side. They are using these events only as a political umbrella for the terrorists, not for the political solution. So, the requirement is that to have one objective. Now, you don't have one objective; you have different objectives, you have at least two objectives. You need to discuss it with the other side, let's call them opposition, whether they are militants or political opposition, but they are different factions and they have different points of views. So, you are not talking about one entity. So, many of the requirements haven't been provided yet in order for these initiatives to succeed till this moment. Now, are we ready to sit? Of course, in Syria we sat with the terrorists, and how can we make those reconciliations if we don't sit with them? From the very beginning, we noted that there was no real and genuine political track for the reason that I just mentioned. So, I said let's go and pave the way for your own political track, which is direct negotiations with the terrorists or militants in different areas, and tell them if you give up your armaments, I will give you amnesty and you go back to your normal life, live normally like any other citizen. Otherwise, if you are not part of this reconciliation, you can leave anywhere you want, and that's what's happening today and yesterday and every day, that's happening from time to time, and that helped the stability in many areas in Syria, and that undermined the terrorists and their masters. So, yes, we are ready to sit with whoever could help us in stopping this blood-shedding in Syria, whoever, we don't have any problem, we don't have any taboo in that regard.

Question 28: But you don't have any preferences as well?

President Assad: In what way, what do you mean?

Journalist: In the way of having some concrete people, concrete names, with whom the Syrian government can talk directly?

President Assad: No, sometimes, you can say I'm going to sit with political opposition, I wouldn't sit with the militants, let's say. I would sit with the opposition that's not linked to Qatar or to Saudi Arabia or to France, and so on. It's not part of the foreigner or foreign agenda against Syria, but at the end, the main question that you are going to ask before starting any negotiation: is he able to deliver? What can he do? If I sit with somebody who doesn't have any influence on the ground, on the reality in Syria, what are we going to agree upon? It's just a waste of time. So, actually we are very pragmatic in that regard; we say let's sit with whoever can change the situation in two ways. The first one is to stop the killing, this is number one, this is a priority for every Syrian, not for the government; every Syrian. If you ask anyone, he'll tell you we need security, we need stability, this is number one. Second, if you want to discuss it politically, you can talk about anything. You can talk about the constitution, the future of Syria, the political system that you want, the economic system; anything is going to be viable. It won't be complicated that time, but without stability, you cannot achieve anything in any negotiation. That's why I said, we went directly to talk to the militants, that is not our preference, as your question, but it's the most effective in the meantime.

Question 29: You've mentioned Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and recently Kazakhstan as a host country of Astana process invited‚Ä¶ not invited, but proposed to invite more countries to this process, including Qatar and the Saudis, how do you think about that?

President Assad: I think the more countries you have, the better, in different ways; you either have more support to this initiative and that will protect that initiative and raise the possibility of success, or you have the same countries that they are going to oppose it whether they are part of it or outside. But if they are part of it, you can point at them, you can tell them that you're part of the problem and you have to help, and if you are genuine about helping, not only by your discourse and rhetoric, this is the initiative, be part of it and show us that you are against the terrorism, show us that you support what the Syrian people want. So, in both ways, it's positive to invite whoever wants to come. So, I support what the Kazakhstani officials announced yesterday about expanding the participation in Astana.

Question 30: Recently, the foreign ministers of Russia, Syria, and Iran assessed their talks in Moscow as a success. Would you like to build on this success and hold that trilateral meeting on a presidential level?

President Assad: It's not about the level, what they expressed in their statements, their views, it represents their presidents, because the minister of foreign affairs, he works with the president anyway. So, it's not about which level, because whoever talks, any official, represents the whole government, the whole state. Maybe if there is a necessity in the future to do it, of course it's a good idea, but for us in Syria, now the priority is to reach the objective. It's not about the formalities, let' say.

Question 31: Let's talk a little bit about the bilateral relations in the economic filed. So, recently, our Vice Prime Minster Dmitry Rogozin has visited Damascus and he said that there was an agreement to promote Russian companies in Syria, and that he received guarantees from you that Russian companies will be well-received and have priorities here. So, what are the specific mechanisms that were established to fulfill this purpose?

President Assad: We have our laws regarding how to make contracts with the different companies. We already started with some of the companies after his visit, especially as the Western companies left Syria, not because of the security situation, not for security reasons, actually for political reasons. So, if we want to call it market, the Syrian market is free now for Russian companies to come and join and to play an important part in rebuilding Syria and investing in Syria. The most important part for me, and I think for them as well, is the oil field, the oil and gas, and some Russian companies now joined, let's say, that sector recently during the last few months, and the process of signing the contracts, the final, let's say, steps of signing the contracts is underway. So, that's how I look at it.

Journalist: Alright Mr. President. Thanks a lot for this interview. It was very frank and very interesting. Thank you very much.

President Assad: Thank you for coming.

Shaaban ha ringraziato la delegazione per la visita in Siria, durante la quale essi saranno in grado di vedere con i propri occhi gli eventi attuali. A suo avviso, il problema principale sta nel fatto che i media occidentali hanno lanciato una campagna di informazione per indurre in errore il mondo pubblico su ci√≤ che sta accadendo in Siria.

Gli eventi in Iraq e in Libia, ha detto Consigliere del Presidente, sono un chiaro esempio di ci√≤ che si sta preparando per il resto dei paesi arabi. Ha denunciato la cooperazione tra la formazione territoriale sionista e i gruppi terroristici armati che combattono in Siria.

Russian military adviser Major Sergei Bordov was killed during militants' attack on a Syrian Army garrison. He prevented the terrorists from entering the inhabited area at the cost of his life, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on thursday.

""In Syria, Russian military adviser Major Sergei Bordov was killed as a result of a militant attack. The serviceman was a member of a unit training Syrian troops,"" it read.

The ministry underscored that the officer organized the defense of Syrian soldiers and prevented the terrorists' breakthrough into the inhabited area.

""During the fight, the officer sustained critical wounds. Major Sergei Bodrov was granted a state decoration posthumously,"" it added.

The ministry disproved a Reuters report about two Russian servicemen allegedly recently killed in Syria.

""Rumours spread by Reuters about the alleged death of two Russian servicemen in Syria are another episode of disinformation that contradicts the reality,"" it said.

On June 16, Russian Sergeant Andrei Timoshenkov died in hospital a day after he had entered into a battle against suicide bombers while guarding a humanitarian aid distribution point in Homs province. The soldier opened fire on one of three vehicles filled with explosives and stopped it, receiving lethal injuries in an explosion.
Since 2011, Syria has been engulfed in a civil war, with government forces fighting against numerous opposition and terrorist groups, including al-Nusra Front and Daesh, banned in a range of countries, including Russia.

Moscow has been conducting a counter-terrorist campaign in Syria since September 30, 2015, at President Bashar Assad's request. In March 2016, the biggest part of Russian air forces left Syria in line with the decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, following successful task fulfillment.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1560977357253905/?type=3,2017-04-20 17:29:45,27,3,2,19,0,0,0,6,2

ISIL leader's top aide killed in #Mosul

Iraqi government forces killed the deputy ringleader of the ISIL terrorist group in Western Mosul in Nineveh province on wednesday.

Federal Police Forces Commander Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat said Abu Abdulrahman, identified as the second-in-command of Daesh (ISIL) and a very close aide to its purported leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed on Wednesday after Iraqi troops lobbed a barrage of missiles at a militant position in the Zanjili neighborhood of Western Mosul, the Arabic-language Shafaaq news agency reported.

Jawdat added that his forces also launched a number of rockets at predetermined targets near Omar al-Aswad Mosque in the al-Farouq district of the Old City of Mosul, killing a high-ranking Daesh militant figure and four other Takfiri terrorists. The commander was later identified as Abu Walid al-Tunisi.

The Iraqi army soldiers continued their military operations in Western part of Mosul, hitting hard the positions of the ISIL terrorist group near the historic Great Mosque of al-Nuri.

Commander of the Federal Police Forces Lt. Gen. Raed Shaker Jawdat said Iraqi troops killed over 60 ISIL militants near the historic Great Mosque of al-Nuri.

He added that the Iraqi government forces also destroyed ISIL military hardware and prevented several suicide bombing attacks in the region.

Iraqi government forces have recaptured more lands in the new round of military operation against ISIL militants in Mosul's Old City in recent days, trying to fully liberate the terrorist group's last bastion.

""Iraqi forces advanced at least 200 meters deeper into the Old City after they launched their operation on Sunday morning from Qadheeb al-Ban area in Western Mosul,"" Jawdat said on Monday.

""Federal police snipers stationed on the roofs of buildings and seized control of the perimeter around the al-Hadba minaret [of the historical Great Mosque of al-Nuri] and targeted the suspicious vehicles and armed persons,"" the commander of the federal police added.

Mosul's al-Nuri mosque is highly symbolic because it was there that leader of the ISIL Takfiri terrorist group, Ibrahim al-Samarrai, also known as Abu Bakr #al_Baghdadi, declared himself the so-called caliphate of the terror group, shortly after the flashpoint city fell to terrorists in June 2014 and became their de facto capital in the Arab country.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced in October 2016, the start of a military operation to recapture Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq which fell to the ISIL since 2014.

The Iraqi defense ministry announced earlier in January that the ISIL terrorist group has lost over 50 percent of its militants in the city of Mosul in Nineveh province as Iraqi troops have managed to recapture the Eastern part of the de facto Capital of the ISIL.

""The intelligence obtained by us indicates that there have been over 6,000 ISIL terrorists in Mosul and around 3,400 of them have been killed in battles with Iraq's joint military forces in the major city of Nineveh province,"" Iraqi Defense Ministry Spokesman Colonel Laith al-Naimi said.

He added that over 250 bomb-laden vehicles and the entire bomb-making workshops of the terrorists have been destroyed in Mosul which means that the #ISIL has been paralyzed by the Iraqi forces.

The Iraqi Army started a new phase of its military operation in Nineveh province late February to drive the ISIL terrorists out of their bastion in the Western part of the city of #Mosul.

With half the city under the control of Baghdad forces, the Iraqi Armed Forces will likely face heavier resistance in the Western part of Mosul, as the ISIL attempts to hold onto their final positions.

Local sources had disclosed that the ISIL is preventing civilians in the Western part of the city of Mosul from leaving the region in a move to use them as human shields as the terrorist group's positions are under intensifying attacks by various troops.

Commanders expect the battle in Western Mosul to be more difficult, in part because tanks and armoured vehicles cannot pass through the narrow alleyways that crisscross ancient districts of the city.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/SYRIAN.SYriaRealInfosAndNews/photos/a.782558295095819.1073741828.782503618434620/1559563000728674/?type=3,2017-04-19 15:16:53,20,0,11,19,0,0,1,0,0

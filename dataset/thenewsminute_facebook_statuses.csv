""I am a Sex Worker from Chennai, and while I did not 'choose' my profession, I have never been ashamed of the work I do. 

But most of the time, I am treated as an object. Almost all of the time, my rights over my body are denied. 

One day, a policeman forced oral sex on me. He had the power of the 'uniform'. He started penetrating my mouth, and too see far I could take it, he inserted his lathi into my mouth to widen it. 

He broke my molar tooth while doing so. I felt humiliated, and I howled in pain. But he neither asked nor cared for my consent. 

In another instance, an acquaintance took me to a client for a professional commitment. But suddenly, the client brought five more men with him. I was shocked, and refused to go with them, but they started molesting and sexually assaulting me. 

They took advantage of my profession, and did not stop to consider me a human being. I was helpless and numb with pain for the next five hours. They left me somewhere at night, and did not even pay me. I struggled to get back home.

But in my line of work, there is little I can do for justice. These are just two such incidents I have faced in my 20-year career. I have also been sexually harassed on the streets too. Once, I took a complaint to the police, and after that experience I have never tried to go back to them for help. Instead of taking my complaint and helping me, they blamed me instead for what happened to me.""

Savita* is a social worker operating in the health sector in Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu. Savita encountered a medical practitioner, who did not take no for an answer to his advances. This is her story...

""In my line of work, I meet various stakeholders in the health sector and this includes doctors. I had a couple of interactions with a medical practitioner. A week after the last meeting I had with him, he called me at 12.30pm.

He asked me if I wanted to watch a movie with him. ""Nobody is home and I thought of taking you to a movie,"" he said. He did not wait for my response, and asked me when he should pick me up. I was shocked at his behaviour and told him quite sternly to never indulge in such talk with me, and disconnected the call.

He did not take no for an answer though. Just two days after this incident, he started sending me messages on WhatsApp. He would say that I looked ""hot"" in my profile picture and would sometimes send me sex-related texts too.

I grew angry by the day and I finally sent him a strongly-worded message telling him to stop sending me any messages at all. Despite this he did not stop and I finally blocked him.

In another instance, I had a meeting with a radiologist who seemed interested in the work that I do. While I was explaining the details of a project to him, he never made eye contact. He rather chose to look at my neck and chest. I felt extremely uncomfortable and got up from my seat with the intention to leave.

He immediately got up and pressed my shoulder down, telling me to ""please be seated"". I was not at all comfortable by his advance and I walked out of the room.

Soon after this incident, I shared my experiences with a colleague who is also a doctor. He suggested that if the harassment continues, I must report it to the management. 

But there are so many questions that linger in my mind. What can the management do if the harassment happens outside its purview? If such instances occur in the future in a public area, are there complaint mechanisms. Even if there is one will the people associated with these helplines address the issue with fairness?""

Glynis Luan Simoes, a cabin crew member, was recently contacted by a former employee of an airline company in India. She was offered a job with a corporate for their charter airlines - but in return, they demanded some 'favours'...

""This happened recently in March-April, 2017. A person called Renuka, who claimed to be a former crew member of an Indian airline contacted me to discuss a possibility of working with an Indian corporate, on their charter airlines. Subsequently, a person called Avinash who said he was from the HR department of the company contacted me regarding the position. 

Following an interview, both, Renuka and Avinash suggested that in order to secure this job, I was to provide some ""personal benefits"" to some members of the HR department. They suggested that sexual compromises were commonplace in this industry, and securing such a job would mean providing such favours.

Completely disgusted with this exchange, I told them that they should not contact me further, regarding this or anything else. 

Following this I filed a complaint and an FIR with the local police station informing them of this incident. They filed my complaint under section 509 (words, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), and have begun their investigation.

I was able to discuss this incident with my colleagues, co-workers and family. They were supportive with my stance to take legal action against these people and I would encourage other women in such a position to do the same. 

No woman should have to rely on anything other than her skills, knowledge and training to secure and keep any job.""

Noor* is a 30-year-old social worker whose colleague tried to make her workplace hostile when she wouldn't return his advances. But Noor's colleagues realised what was happening...

""I used to work as an area coordinator with an NGO working towards waste management in Pune in 2014. We were a four-member team; there was another person, Ankur*, who was in the same position as me, although he had more experience. We hit it off instantly. Long conversations, friendly banter, it was all good.

There were times where I felt he was dropping me hints that he was interested in me. He would continuously stare at me during meetings, for example. I can't pinpoint to particular instances because it was never overt. It was always the way he conducted himself physically, little gestures, eye contact and so on. 

It made me uncomfortable, but since he was married, and I was quite open about my own relationship, I didn't make a big deal of it. But then one day he realised that I wasn't going to respond to his advances or encourage him, and that's when things changed. 

Ankur stopped talking to me and treated me coldly. He wouldn't give weight to my ideas and suggestions in meetings. I tried to raise complaints about how he was arbitrarily taking decisions, but nothing deterred him.

He even told our senior management that I wanted to leave because work was too far away for me. When the lady in charge called me and told me they could ask someone else to take my position, I was shocked. I told her quite vehemently that that I did not want to quit. 

But they gave me an area transfer anyway. I was quite upset initially but it worked out for the best. I believe that the women who were at senior positions understood what was happening and sought to remove Ankur from my work path. It could have been a very different story if there had been men at the senior positions. 

The whole ordeal lasted 3-4 months and it was quite traumatic because I didn't know what was happening. He didn't do anything explicit to sexually harass me, it was all body language and mind games. I've realised that just because you are liberal, doesn't mean everyone is. And that male egos are very fragile.""

1375307999395597_1871466619779730,"How I won a case of sexual harassment against professors at my film institute

Kunjila Mascillamani is a 25-year-old filmmaker, was assigned to work on a project with a student who had sexually harassed her in the past. Upset with the decision, Kunjila approached the institute's director. When she pursued her case, it opened a can of worms - and complaints poured in about some professors too...

""When I was student of direction at Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute in Kolkata, I was working on a film in December 2015 and the student assigned to be on the edit team had a history of sexually harassing me. I didn't want to work with him but when I approached my dean, he laughed at me. So, I went to the director of the institute, asking him that I needed a forum to talk about the issue.

It was then that I found out that each government institute at least, is supposed to have an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to deal with cases of sexual harassment at the workplace. The chairperson of the ICC then called a meeting with all the girls, and to our shock, many girls spoke about being sexually harassed by professors as well as fellow students.

The next day, 7-8 of us filed written complaints with the ICC. I had named two professors and two students in my complaint. One of these professors had also raped me, but I told the ICC that I did not want to pursue the case legally. In total, three professors were named, all complaints put together.

What followed for the next eight months was absolute hell. We were isolated and slut-shamed. No one spoke to us. Some of the professors even instigated other students, who then threatened and assaulted us a couple of times, thinking that we were lying. Some of us weren't able to find projects to work on because we were bad mouthed to our prospective employers.

I was already on medication but the whole situation had taken an even more severe toll on my mental and emotional health. 

We eventually won the case in the ICC and two of the professors were sent into early retirement. They have now filed a motion in the Kolkata High Court challenging the ICC's decision.

But SRFTI forwarded the rape case I had filed against the third professor to the police, without my consent. The case is now ongoing in the Kolkata High Court, but I haven't been called for any hearings so far.

I graduated two months ago and now work in Mumbai. I have moved on with my life but the whole ordeal was traumatising. I still suffer from the psychological effects, but I am glad that it wasn't all for nothing. At least our juniors and the younger students won't have to go through what we did.""

Sushma*, a domestic worker, was employed in the house of Jonathan*. Sushma says her daughter, who also worked in the same house as a babysitter, was sexually harassed by Jonathan. And when she questioned her employer, he resorted to assaulting her too. This is her story:

""I worked as a domestic help at a house in Bellandur in October 2016. My 19-year-old daughter, Divya*, would accompany me to babysit the children of the couple who lived there.

One day, Jonathan*, the man of the house, tried to compel my daughter to buy a swimsuit even though she said she was uncomfortable with it. He showed her pictures of women in swimsuits on his laptop, when she didn't want to look at them. He even showed her porn clips. When I confronted him, he denied showing her anything 'wrong.'

Another time, he told me to do somersaults when I didn't know how. He kept harassing my daughter, making her uncomfortable. I strictly told him to leave her alone many times, but he did not listen. Tired of his harassment, we approached the society's residents' welfare committee. The committee members were scared that Jonathan would harm their kids, and told me to file a police complaint.

Divya and I quit without taking the Rs 37,000 salary he owed us at that point. We tried going to the police, but they just mocked us and did not file an FIR. In the meantime, Jonathan's harassment continued. He went to the employers at the other houses we worked at, and told them that we had stolen from him. We lost many jobs this way. But there were others who trusted us and didn't believe him.

We contacted an NGO too, and went to the police again. But once again, the FIR wasn't filed. 

Then, in mid-March, I was walking to work when Jonathan pulled up next to me in a car and pushed me to the ground. I was very disoriented, and before I knew it, he had hit the back of my head with a rock and sped away.

The only good thing that came out of this perhaps was that the police could see the wound and had to file a complaint. The FIR was registered on charges of sexual harassment at the workplace, and assault.

Jonathan is still at large though. And while Divya and I have moved on with our lives now and we still live in fear, he continues to harass my employers now and then. But who will help us?""

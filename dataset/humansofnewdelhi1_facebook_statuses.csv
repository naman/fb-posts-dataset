A Teach for India fellow, Anshu, had this to say:

""It was 8'o'clock in the morning when I was standing with my other three fellows from Teach for India, waiting for the morning assembly to start. We were standing at the back and looking at our girls. What we could discern from the back that the girls were shivering in the damp foggy cold. We went forward and ask our girls, ""are you girls alright?"" In a quivering voice, they answered, ""Ma'am and Sir, it's very cold."" It took us a moment realize that few of our girls don't have warmers. Some of them were wearing a pair of summer clothes under their school uniforms and some of them were wearing low-quality warmers that were pretty useless against the harsh cold.

This made us come up with an idea of a secret Santa, where each one us can become a secret Santa for these girls on this Christmas. We decided to create a fund and buy all girls thermals and warmers for winter. And this where we need your help!

There are 160 girls in our classes and we are now raising funds to place a bulk order. We need a little over Rs. 65k and we need your help in raising the required amount and making this a Merry Christmas for our girls!""

Next they asked for the details of the vehicle and I told them it belonged to me friend. Well, turns out it wasn't. He had borrowed his father's car. By now the inspector was adamant on calling our parents but we somehow managed to make them call our professor instead. He took his sweet time, it was late in the night and I was hungry. I had already created enough trouble for the day and I really did not want to create a scene so I snuck around and finally got to the cake when the inspector noticed me.

I passed them again on my way back and he came running to me. ""Mera ek photo kheecho (Take my photograph),"" he said. I asked him what happened to him. He said brushed it off with a quick ""Main jal gya tha (I got burnt)"" and before I could ask anything else, he ran away as quickly as he had approached me. No questions about the photograph, not even a simple 'show me.' Nothing. Kids are mysterious creatures.

Edit: A few comments later, I realised that perhaps I failed in putting across the interaction effectively and hence this little note.

He didn't run away afraid or traumatised or uncomfortable. He ran away the same way he had run to me - with enthusiasm. He answered my question with absolute nonchalance and just gladly returned to what he was doing before he walked up to me. I did not leave the scene and neither did he. He just resumed playing across the road. That's all.

I'm not refuting your astute observation, nor am I denying the possibility that I may have made him uncomfortable. I wish I had a way of knowing whether or not I did, but unfortunately, that is not possible now. Equally unfair are the assumptions that have been made. I'm not claiming that I am completely free of blame. Of course not.

So instead we focused on the everyday awesome, the seemingly inconsequential people we pass on the streets... people we occasionally wonder about but seldom speak to. We wanted to speak to them, to learn their stories, their dreams and aspirations and their struggles.
Over time, people have asked us repeatedly why we do what we do. What we - two working professionals with demanding day jobs - hope to achieve with this project. To be perfectly honest, we just wanted everyone to know Delhi and its people like we knew them.
We hope we can continue this journey and we hope you'll stick with us.

Their playful banter was a sight for sore eyes, so I just took out my camera and started clicking away...

That's when the action unfolded. The kites, probably annoyed with the dog, retaliated. But instead of attacking the dog, they made a hapless little pup their target. The dog, when it realised what was happening, went after the kites with a ferocity that even scared me. 

It was clear that the wouldn't let me anywhere near the pup at that instant, so I hung back for a minute or two and then approached them in as non-intimidating fashion as possible. That's when I discovered the second pup! Badly wounded, and barely moving. I tried to soothe the dog, picked up the pups and carried them to safety. 

This is not a story about anybody's heroics. The reason I felt the need to share this incident is to highlight the selfless act of that one dog who knew he'd be attacked and hurt, but went in to rescue the pup anyway.

We started this page with a simple intention - to gain a new perspective. How many times have we passed an interesting human on the street and wondered what their story might be? It is very easy to see someone once and write them off as a stereotype in our heads, but that's not how the world functions. As this page progresses, so does our journey into imagining others complexly.

It has not been an easy journey. We have been threatened, we've been accosted, we have experienced hostility of the kind we didn't imagine existed; once my friend and collaborator on this project - Rajib - almost had his camera broken. But if anything it has only provoked us, driven us to take this further and while 18 days into the project might not seem like much, the change it has brought about in our lives is remarkable. 

We have learnt a great deal about ourselves, about our fellow humans of New Delhi, maybe even a little bit about humans in general, but most importantly, we have learnt the importance of staying open-minded, of accepting others as they are, of celebrating humanity.

So here's to all of you who have made this worthwhile and provided us the much-required impetus -
Thank you!

As such, it is easy to lose sight of why we celebrate this day, and why indeed this simple choice - to celebrate any day any which way we like - is so important. This is not a day to celebrate independence, not anymore. It is a day to celebrate choices - the right ones - and remind ourselves to stay on the right path because one wrong choice might lead to huge consequences; it could very well mean another 200 years of servitude. That's what I remind myself every year. That's how I celebrate.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/HumansOfNewDelhi1/photos/a.1397790897104229.1073741828.1397396907143628/1402113976671921/?type=3,2013-08-16 08:27:31,16,0,1,16,0,0,0,0,0

188056068070045_645300165678964,"While growing up, I would notice that the women around me would work very hard at home but still weren't well respected because they were economically dependent.  It was since then that I wanted to be financially empowered.  I knew I wanted to be a designer when I was 15 — it was just one of those things that was my calling. My mother would teach me how to cook and then think that I was learning some 'basic embroidery' like all 'good girls' are supposed to — she never thought of it as anything more.  But the business bug caught on early — since my first year of college I would participate in exhibitions with my friends and all the clothes we made would sell out — I've been financially independent since I was 20!
Initially, my parents were against me starting a business.  It was 1982 and women were expected to just get married — but I couldn't be stopped.  I sat in my room with two tailors and designed from there, because my work has been my religion — it's that sacred for me.  My parents used to watch people coming home through the day wanting me to design and they would ask , 'are these people really coming for your clothes?' and I think that's when they slowly accepted my work.
Around this time, I met my husband — we'd been dating on the sly for a few years, because we were from different religions and my parents were  against it.  But he was a charmer — one by one he started meeting all of my family members and they fell in love with him and then they all got together to convince my dad— it was all very filmy!  It's funny how we even spoke about marriage — my friends asked me 'where's this heading?' and I said, ' I don't know let me ask him'  so one day while we were hanging out I just popped the question- 'so what are we? Are we friends? Are we just having fun? Are you going to marry me? — I need to know' and he said, 'ofcourse we're getting married!' and that was that!
There was never a question of me stopping work post marriage. Very often, it's taken for granted that if there is a choice between a man's career and a woman's career — the woman will give hers up.  A woman's career choices are somehow never given as much importance — but I made it infinitely clear that work is my religion.  I still remember once, very early on in our marriage when my in-laws wanted me to stay at home and not attend a particular fashion week — they thought this was just some hobby I'd picked up and I could miss it…but I went and spoke to my husband and said, 'I have to go— it's important' and he said 'I'll handle it, don't worry' and that's the kind of support every woman needs.  I've been through pregnancy, and been involved in my son's life — but that didn't ever mean that I would stop working.  There have been days I've missed his PTA meetings, or sports days and as much as I would have liked to be there, sometimes I just couldn't make it and sometimes my husband couldn't — why is it always taken badly if a mother can't make it but it's okay if the father can't?
At times we both couldn't make it and we've had an excellent support system — my mother, mother in law and sisters who have stood by us and in so many ways they're the reason I'm here today.  From two sewing machines in my balcony, to a brand, from that first Anita Dongre store at Crossroads to hundreds… if I didn't have these people by my side and I wasn't so stubborn about fighting for what I love every step of the way… I would have never made it.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/645300165678964/?type=3,2017-04-27 08:39:26,12077,454,1210,9846,1916,307,6,2,0

188056068070045_644449719097342,"""I grew up in a small village of Bihar which was prone to flooding.  Most of my childhood memories involve me playing in the mud and  swimming in a pond near our house — we all learnt to swim by ourselves.  I  grew up in a family of wrestlers, so even though I moved to Bombay for my education, I had a strong inclination towards sports. I'm from a humble background — I went to a Municipal school in Byculla and then got a diploma in mechanical engineering but my biggest interest was Karate.  I juggled studying late hours and training at sion until I was exhausted and this went on until I became a black belt in 2008.  That was just the beginning — I won 54 medals and won gold medals at the national and international level until one day in 2010, I felt a severe pain while walking and decided to get it checked.  
The MRI scan revealed that I had a tumour in my spinal chord. Even though the doctors said I would be able to walk again, two surgeries later I was still paralyzed.  This was the most depressing phase of my life — even my family members, except my mother and sister weren't supportive.  They kept saying 'my life was over' and how 'I used to be so capable'.  I felt frustrated — just because I was disabled meant my life was over?  That ideology is so screwed up — even the certificate I received from my doctor said '100% disabled' and I wondered how can someone else certify that I was a 100% incapable?
This pushed me to prove a point and I decided to start with something like swimming — I went to Shivaji Park Gymkhana and on seeing me on a wheelchair even the staff there were paranoid — they said they wouldn't let me swim without a supervisor.  I don't know how I got the courage, but I told them to just give me a chance and even though I hadn't swam after my surgeries, I took a leap of faith and jumped in... and I was okay!  I could swim with ease and from there I juggled my job at IBM and focused on my training. 
I won may awards at the national level as a paraplegic athlete, but I couldn't make it to the International level because I had no sponsorship.  Finally in 2015 my prayers were answered — I received a full scholarship from Sathyabama University an MBA school in Chennai and what's more is that the principal believed in me and decided to sponsor my training as well.  I left my job at IBM and haven't looked back since.  I trained harder than ever and in 2016 represented India at the International level in Canada and won a bronze medal!  Ever since, I'm training to participate in the 2018 Para Olympics in Tokyo and what's even better is that I found out that there's something known as 'wheelchair Karate' that I'm so excited about!
All I can say is, no one can motivate you but yourself.  From having a certificate that said 100% disabled — It now says that I'm 71% disabled, from having no hope of ever competing as a sportsman again I'm training for the para olympics!  I'm also the world record owner for longest open sea swimming in 2016.  How I did it?  I just said-  'so what?' and found a solution… Disabled, yes…but so what? There are a hundred things I can still do and I won't stop until I've achieved everything I've ever dreamed of.

I'm unmarried and apart from my uncle who had adopted me, I had no one to comfort me at that point — I felt so alone that there were times when I looked out at the Church from my hospital window and felt helpless. 
It was after a couple of weeks of treatment that I decided I didn't want to feel that way anymore — I wanted to take control of my life and not surrender to a disease.  I began to actively remain positive, did yoga and took one day at a time.  I convinced myself with the explanation that even a really bad day only has 24 hours and the next day holds limitless possibilities…and even though both my ovaries were removed, I worked towards being healthier…towards being happier.  
I conquered cancer once, but 3 years later I relapsed — this time it was a lump in my neck.  I had to undergo surgery again but I was more determined then ever to push my limits.  I got this butterfly tattoo to remind myself that from a dark cocoon emerges a beautiful butterfly.  I shifted my focus after my surgery to spending time with friends and their children, I went to church, I worked out, I cooked for my doctors at Bombay hospital — basically anything that made me happy.
Truth is, I defeated cancer twice only because I wanted to for myself.  Ever so often, we depend on others to pamper us and make us strong, but the strength lies within — that's my biggest learning from this.  When push comes to shove, you have to make yourself strong, you have to love yourself so much that no disease, no negativity can touch you and that's why I'm glad. Cancer taught me to love myself and when that didn't seem to work…it taught me to not succumb and love myself even harder.""

The only thing Jonathan responded to was music — from a young age he would hum the tunes of melodies perfectly so we encouraged his love for music and kept working in that direction.  We also encouraged his parents to begin taking him out into public places…they were scared of doing that before.  Slowly, we began to get the feeling that he was on the verge of speaking…it was just a matter of when.  
This one day, when Jonathan's mother was telling me that she was going to church and leaving him behind with us, I insisted that she took him with her. She was hesitant but agreed.  Later that afternoon, I got a call from her telling me that something had happened.  She told me she had taken Jonathan to church with her and that he had been very quiet all through.  Then the Sermon started, there was pin drop silence and all of a sudden a loud but babyish voice filled the church with a romantic number — it was Jonathan!  He sang the line, 'Oh, my love come and lose yourself in my arms' over and over, and the Sermon was interrupted as people cheered him on! 
Ever since he made his entry into church with a bang, Jonathan hasn't looked back — he's a well grown, hefty boy with an enormous appetite for food, singing and chatting…in fact he doesn't keep quiet.

We realised we had feelings for each other only when she took a 20 day trip abroad, and we were out of touch for that period.  She would still call me once a week whenever she could make an ISD call…but I missed her, I missed talking to her everyday and when she came back she told me the same thing!  We both confessed our feelings to each other and began to date.  Of course, initially it was difficult because of both of us being in wheelchairs and a lot of time we both needed help — sometimes to use the restroom when we were eating at a restaurant or to get out of a cab but we got by!  People have always been so kind to us — I still remember this one time when the restaurant owner asked these people who were halfway through their meal to shift tables as it would be more convenient to us and they didn't even hesitate once!
So we've gotten by and we've been dating for over 7 years now — but very early on I knew I wanted to marry her.  She brings out the best in me and she's so thoughtful that I wonder how I ever got so lucky — she's saved every little memory of ours whether a movie ticket or our conversations from BBM to whatsapp to MSN and she just makes everything so special!  I knew I wanted to marry her come what may but both are parents were very against it.  They had questions like 'how will both of you manage?' 'atleast one of you should be able'  but through these past few years we've shown them that we can more than manage.  We've tried being independent and doing things on our own and as for the rest, when we live together we'll figure it out together.  In fact, we've learnt to be around one another and support each other so much that we recently went to Goa together alone and it was by far the best time and that's what we're looking forward to forever.  We may be differently abled, but together we're so complete…together we're two parts of one whole.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/636539333221714/?type=3,2017-04-10 08:34:24,15043,433,879,11635,3107,296,1,4,0

188056068070045_634982936710687,"""Being Shammi Kapoor's son, I entered the film industry when I was just 16 years old.  I was assisting on films and within a few short years, I knew the industry inside out…I even acted in a couple of films, but I felt that my calling was somewhere else.  I also became increasingly spiritual at the time, so I took the difficult decision of leaving the RK banner and making something off myself…from scratch.  I didn't know anything about running a business, but I first began selling Kolhapuri chappals and later exporting them.  I then worked in warehousing and when I had saved enough money, I started my own business, rented warehouses and trucks.  On days I didn't have money to hire labourers, so I would load the trucks myself and people would pass snide remarks like— 'look Shammi Kapoor's son can't even afford labourers' — but I wanted to create a name for myself and thankfully, life unfolded with a lot of success.
Finally, I decided to retire from my 9 to 9 work like and become a full time biker and a full time writer and it all started with a simple desire to explore my country first, before the rest of the world.  Through Scout My Trip, I covered 8000 kms across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Himachal, Nepal and Bhutan and found so much humility within my people that I felt the need to reach out more.  I then started biking for a cause through Rang De, where I travelled to Yavatmal and other villages to raise money for women entrepreneurs specifically.  
What touched me the most was how humble, warm and welcoming they all were — they had so little but not once did they hesitate to invite me to eat with them and share their supplies.  1 lady in particular called Pramila struck a chord in my heart — she was all alone and living in a small tin shed hut in the village.  I later found out that before receiving a loan to start breeding animals, her house consisted of saris that she tied together…that is how dire the situation is for such a large part of our country but she only got out of it because of the loan she received...such a small amount changed her life completely.
At 60, I'm now looking forward to 'quest' where I'll be travelling 50,000 kms across our globe, in the hope that I can meet more people, spread awareness and maybe through the way discover more about myself.  It's going to be 10 months long and I'm going to be riding solo but as long as there's fuel in my tank and humility in my soul…I'll be okay.  At 60, I feel as excited as a 16 year old taking on a new journey — with a hundred possibilities and so much to still discover.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/634982936710687/?type=3,2017-04-07 08:42:19,7517,194,449,6636,666,214,1,0,0
188056068070045_633770976831883,"""It started when I was in the 10th grade — it wasn't even any external pressure, it was the pressure I put on myself to do well in my boards.  The signs were small in the beginning —  I used to be irritable and snap at little things. Even my parents didn't read too much into it…we all just assumed it was exam pressure. 
My boards came and went, I even managed to do well but I began to get anxious about everything around me.  My irritable nature escalated to me getting infuriated and becoming violent — I would become impossible to control.  My parent's decided to take me to a counsellor and at first I was terrified.  Things are a bit more open now, but 8 years ago 'counsellor' and 'mental illness' meant people would think you were crazy, but I was feeling so suffocated  that I had no option but to go.  My counsellor told me that in addition to having anxiety, I also had OCD and the combination of the two led to depression.  
How do I explain that feeling to you?  I would have random, illogical thoughts and they would play on loop in my head until I couldn't take it anymore. Thoughts like, 'what if I lose my brother tomorrow?' would play in my head for hours and I wouldn't be able to focus on anything else.  I began to feel hopeless — it didn't matter whether I had a good day — my anxiety would make me believe that it was impossible for me to be happy and that something bad would happen.  Getting out of the house was far,  I wouldn't leave my bed for weeks together, I was taking 12 pills a day and from being a fit teenager of 70kgs, I became an obese adult of 124 kgs.  I went through hours of counselling and through the 8 years contemplated committing suicide multiple times simply because it just seemed like there was no way out.  I stopped meeting people because I was afraid that at any point my thoughts would spiral and I would break down or become violent…so I lost a lot of my friends through the years. 
How else do I explain depression? You go to sleep at night being okay to not wake up the next day.  Nothing feels good and you just feel alone…even though your loved ones are around you.  But let me tell you, the only thing that got me through this is the fact that my family stood by me even when I was the worst version of myself.  I still remember this one time when I was just breaking things and I saw how scared my parents were…they cried because even they felt helpless.  After I calmed down, my mom came and told me 'just keep the faith, there will be a better tomorrow. Hold on, we're all with you.'  
Somewhere within me, the need to get better stirred.  I had been trying; everyone tries but I wanted to push myself more.  I would spend hours reading people's experiences online and stories oh how they made it out of depression.  I began to try a little bit more everyday to not give energy to harmful thoughts.  I would watch funny videos and try and leave the house more.  There wasn't one single moment when I became better, but sometimes that 1 extra percent, on one random day will make the switch — and that's what happened.  I began to lose weight — I lost 30 kgs in the past 2 years, I slowly began to stop my medication and started working full time on my own comedy videos —yes, I actually make other people laugh now! 
So my message is this — I know a lot of times these will seem like empty words, but if you're undergoing depression you're not alone… it will get better.  You're hearing it from someone who's been there for 8 years…I hit rock bottom for that long and got out of it.  Hold on a bit longer, talk to your loved ones and know that there will be one day when the switch will happen and you will be happy again…you will learn to love yourself again.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/633770976831883/?type=3,2017-04-05 08:31:23,10050,358,920,8378,1468,177,3,24,0
188056068070045_633158433559804,"""Growing up, I was always the student who wanted to participate in everything.  From playing football to participating in fashion shows I was always very out there — I loved fashion; I used to enjoy being unique and standing out of the crowd — it was just a part of my personality, which often led me to being misunderstood. 
Even after joining my architecture course, I would always be known on campus as the 'fashionable one' — but I never dreamed of ever doing anything in that space.  I was always on a tight budget, so most of my shopping would be on the streets…I would buy things for 200 Rupees and still bargain — but I enjoyed putting different things together and making a statement.  In fact, I randomly heard about Instagram from someone at college and realised that I couldn't even download it on my Nokia phone— it was only available on Android and IOS! So whenever I wanted to post about something, I would borrow my dad's phone and quickly upload to my account.
I also always loved architecture — so whenever I would travel for my course I would post my experiences…and I don't even know how my followers started to build.  It was in my 3rd year of architecture that I got a KT and couldn't stand for General Secretary in my 4th year and I was devastated!  But as it turns out…it all worked out for the best because people started recognising my work and I got my own YouTube Channel!
From there things just fell into my lap — I began to combine my love for architecture and fashion to create my content, I built my own website from scratch and what started off as my passion became a full fledged career.  I've even faced my fair share of criticism…so many times people have commented on my photos saying, 'she's so dark, how is she a blogger?', or 'I've met her, she's much darker than this photo'  As a 20 year old, I was so sensitive to simple things like a 'dislike' on my video.  For the longest time, I was conscious about a scar I had on my leg from playing football — I stopped travelling by train because I felt so conscious of myself.  For the longest time, I led a dual life — I would go to college, work hard on my assignments and not care about what I wore and then reach home and transform.  It was through this journey that I began to become comfortable with myself as is — scars, skin colour and criticism alike.  I loved myself so fiercely that the world had no option but to accept and love me as well. 
From that young architecture student who would excitedly binge shop and hustle through the street stores — I'm here.  I've been on the cover of magazines, I've won awards, I travel solo for work internationally and most importantly I'm financially independent. All of this because, I decided to love myself as is and didn't wait for acceptance — I demanded it.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/633158433559804/?type=3,2017-04-04 09:21:07,9882,349,392,8272,1474,134,2,0,0
188056068070045_631948193680828,"I had no symptoms of cancer.  I had just been coughing a lot and as a precautionary measure my doctor asked me to get some X-rays done.  I took my health and body so much for granted that I thought, 'why should I waste 6000 Rupees on a scan…it's just a regular cough', but my husband pushed me to get it.  When the doctor broke the news to me, I remember feeling numb.  I was 6 years old when my father passed away of cancer and at that moment my own son was 6 and I was diagnosed. 
I wanted to desperately get better for my family, so I made it a point to never cry in front of them but there were days when I would cry in my office cubicle and come out, ready to get into meetings again.  I had to undergo chemo sessions every 15 days, but I made it a point to never stop working — I didn't want cancer to get the better of me.  Everyday I would travel from Dahisar to Lower Parel by train for work, attend meetings and undergo the chemo cycle and resume the same routine. 
At first I was so fearful, but the only thing that allowed me to get better was the fact that I didn't give cancer any energy…I didn't allow the negativity to get to me. There were times  when I felt weak…my hair had began falling out and I locked myself in my office cubicle for 20 minutes, cried but then gave myself a pep talk.  I used to tell myself I'm healthy and that I'm too strong to give up — it was all self motivation.  I would break down, but I would yank myself out of it just as quick and that's how I beat cancer— twice.  If my experience has taught me anything it's just that — you can either allow a negative situation to get the better out of you, or look it in the eye, pick yourself up and beat it with positivity.  Believe me, you're powerful enough within you to overcome anything…you just have to tap into that inner strength.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/631948193680828/?type=3,2017-04-02 10:13:31,12877,355,715,10838,1685,335,2,17,0

Within a minute, this boy from her class offered his box to her and said 'sharing is caring' — and she started smiling from ear to ear!

I then met this gentleman who I grew fond of, but like the other families, they too wanted me to stay at home.  I told him about my dream of wanting my own clinic and he said two words - 'trust me' and I don't know why, but I did because he was so genuine.

The first time I fell critically ill was when I was 6 years old — I cried so much that I turned completely blue and at that age I had my first major heart surgery. 
As time passed, I kept falling more ill and most of the times the tests we did we did were inconclusive.  I still remember those nights, mom would hug me tight and say everything will be okay but in the middle of the night I would feel her tears all over my tshirt.  Nothing was worse than that pain — I just wanted to get better so that she would stop worrying. 
It was around this time when one day while trying to urinate, I felt a pain so bad that my whole body became stiff and I started screaming for my mother and aunty to come help me.  It was then that we realised that the problem was with my kidney. 
Ever since then, I've been getting dialysis every single day — needles and syringes have become my friends.  It's so painful still, but I don't like showing that because then my mother starts crying and I just want her to be happy.

That's exactly how I used to feel about my husband — nothing in the world could shake us, because when the rest of the world slips away you have something that matters and that gives you courage to face anything.  
At just 25, he passed away because of a heart attack and believe nothing in life can prepare you for that kind of pain. I had my daughters to look after, but I couldn't function for weeks.  
But love is such a funny thing, it lasts longer than a lifetime even.  I began to hear his voice in my head telling me to be strong; to think about our children…to think of him. I don't know how it happened, but I picked myself up and got this new burst of energy.  
I took up two full time jobs — as domestic help in the day and at a construction site at night, to make sure my daughters continue to go to school and we have enough to eat.

Mind you, all of these films had huge male co-stars and directors, but the failure of movies was blamed upon my bad luck.  Thereafter, I've been asked to reduce my pay, I've been thrown out of films because the producer was having financial issues.

She reminded me of a child with an innocent heart and I just wanted to take care of her.  A few months later I told my parents I wanted to marry this girl but they were against her completely.  I realised then that they wanted a few gifts from her family and wanted her parents to be there for the ceremony.

I became a young mother around the age of 15 after being raped by an uniformed man back in Nepal. I remember playing in the temple with no idea of what is the world when life changed for me. The father of the baby ran away as soon as he discovered that I was with his child. From being a carefree teenager I began begging in the temple for myself and my daughter -- we lived on the crumbs and clothes people gave us.
I continued living in the temple and cooking for them in exchange for shelter when I was approached by a man — he used to come regularly to the temple. I was cooking on the chulha one day when he called me and said, 'if you come with me I will take you to my sister's place in India. There won't be any tension of money then"". As a scared girl of 16 with a baby, I eagerly nodded my head and followed him blindly because I was desperate to get my daughter out of the situation we were in. 
However after I reached Pune, I realised that I wasn't going to work as domestic help.  The 'sister' he had mentioned was a brothel keeper and I had been sold for Rs. 1 lakh. I cried so much that I used to turn red. I refused to work in that trade for the first 5 months that I was in Pune. I used to be beaten with sticks and slapped until I bled by the agent who bought me He used to force me to go with a man who repelled me. The man used to drag me and force himself on me.
Soon this agent sold me to a seth in Bombay for Rs. 60 thousand as I was too difficult for him to manage. The seth was nice. Once I came to Mumbai, life was pretty different. I started willingly going for the kind of work which I refused earlier because I had no other way to feed my daughter. I used to leave her with a  lady nearby who I paid Rs. 4000 every month. By this time I was already infected with TB and HIV. I was a lost and wasted life, when I was young itself.
Nine years in the brothels of Mumbai, numerous fights with the brothel keeper, alcohol addiction, living in deplorable conditions and entertaining drunk men; I finally chose to leave the area when hope was offered to me by Purnata.
I dream of living with my daughter together someday, who is now in a hostel. Hopefully I will get a good employment after finishing my training.  My life is about her now — I don't know how long I'll live, but I want to make sure she's educated and supports herself.  My life has been miserable, but I draw strength and motivation from wanting to raise her well.  The strength I've had these past few years have been solely because I'm a mother…else I'd have given up long back.  But I won't give up — I'm not ready to let these men, who came night after night to break me.  I'm a fighter…I won't let them win.""

Back then I thought he was being emotional,  but now that he's no more and I look back, those words mean everything to me.

I was overjoyed that I had a son, but I knew I wanted to raise him right.  It's okay if he cries and if he shows his emotions — my wife and I are constantly telling him that crying doesn't make him any less of a man.  We teach him to respect girls as equals and even in little things like a game of football or cricket to not make fun of them — that's where it all begins.  
Just the other day at the park, they were playing football and right before this small girl was about to kick the ball, a boy shouted — 'don't kick like a girl…we'll lose' and everyone began to laugh.  That small girl looked so shaken, but before anyone could say anything my son went upto her and said, 'kick like a girl…that's how we'll show them how to win!' and I promise you, that girl was beaming — she played like a real rockstar.  
As a father, I felt proud because the boys we raise today are the men of tomorrow.  Everyday we hear things about women empowerment and feminism but I'm trying to teach my son that women don't need to be empowered— they already are. By trying to empower them, we're proving that they're weaker and need us to help them.

188056068070045_620769294798718,"""I was raised in a middle class family that placed the most importance on education and being financially independent.  I was one of the 50 students hired by Grindlays Bank right after graduating from DSE and I started at the bottom.  My first few stints included delivering pizza to my bosses, labelling 15,000 chairs and keeping stock of stationery, but I loved it!  It was a male dominated work environment, and most people thought I would get married and quit…no one really took me seriously.  But I did everything to excel — I would study long hours after work, I would be the first one to enter and last one to leave.  In fact, I met my husband at this company and even though I was married at the age of 24 — my passion to make it never died. 
Even when I was pregnant,  believe it or not I was working right 'till the day of my delivery — I finished my meeting and left straight from office for my surgery! Back then, the maternity leave was just 3 short months and there were no creches at work — so I would bundle my daughter up with the nanny, keep her in a hotel nearby and rush in between work to feed her.  While my daughter was growing up, I realised that the stereotypes are created by society and on so many occasions by women.  I remember, I was traveling for work once and couldn't attend her parent-teacher meet, so my husband took her instead and all the mother's there applauded him for being so 'involved'— he came back feeling on top of the world but for mothers it's considered a part of their duty and that's where the problem lies.  I was termed, a 'bad mother' because I couldn't make it and this is 1 of a 100 incidents. Once when he took her to a birthday party, everyone there praised him and said, 'your wife is so lucky — you're a great husband'.  He is the best man I could have ever asked for, but why does society place men on a higher pedestal?  Isn't he as responsible for her school and extra curricular activities as I am? Aren't we equals? 
When she was 2 years old and had 104 fever, I had a road show the next day — so my husband stayed at home and asked me not to worry.  Leaving my daughter behind when she was ill doesn't mean I don't love her-- on any other day I would have taken that day off…but my husband did it instead…so does that make me a bad mother? 
My fight is not about my work, it's about not having gender equality.  As a working woman, I've been so disciplined and made my way to being the CEO of UBS, I've cracked billion dollar deals and gone home after to help my daughter with her science project.  I'm on the World's top 50 women on the business list, we set up Moelis from scratch and I still have 20 hour days but that doesn't make me any less of a homemaker.  If we really want to progress, gender equality should be on top of the list — where men and women are equals, where a woman's career is deemed as important as a man's and where a man isn't treated like God for being involved at school or in the house.  Just basic equality.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/620769294798718/?type=3,2017-03-11 07:13:42,64117,2066,13967,54445,8442,1195,27,4,4

I loved my job, but like everything in life it had it's own drawbacks — I had to stay away from my wife for extended periods of time.  We had the kind of relationship where we were always making fun of each other and cracking jokes, but when I was away from her I would write her long love letters telling her how much I loved her and how much I missed hearing her laugh.  Because she couldn't send letters back to me, she would reply to each and every one of them and wait for me to come back home.  Then when I was leaving again, she would hand me all of them at once to read when I was away.  I used to devour her letters — reading them slowly and over and over again.  
We've been through a lot together…we lost our daughter when she was 1 and a half years old and that's one of the few times I've seen her break down — she was a strong woman.  Even when she would fall sick and I was away, she wouldn't tell me so I didn't worry…but I would worry.  I remember once when she fell ill, I rushed home and the whole way there I kept thinking that I would quit my job to be with her…I couldn't bear the thought of not spending enough time with her. 
It was when she was ill that I was joking with her and said, 'your husband will mark a century' and she said, 'it better be alone, I can't tolerate you for so long'.  We both laughed, but deep down we both knew even a 100 years together would be less.  I'm 95 today and she left me a few years ago…so I'm actually closing in on a 100 years without her.  At first I was shattered and didn't want to live without her, but then I kept picturing her, and her laughter and knew that she would have liked me to remain strong.

This Women's day, Humans of Bombay launches an initiative to try and alleviate the dire situation some of these women are in. From being sold by their own husbands and families to being forced into the sex trade out of no other choice — these women redefine strength and courage to deal with situations which are inhuman. Most of these women have children to support…in fact most of them continue to work to educate their children, so that they don't ever have to be a part of the red light area.

Purnata, an NGO based in Bombay, looks after women who want to leave the sex trade and rehabilitate themselves. They also look after the expenses of sending their children to school. With the financial help of this campaign, they will be able to extend their help to the hundreds of women in the sex trade, who want to leave but don't have a way out. Let's give them a way out.

It was when I was here working in Bombay that my dad became completely paralysed and that incident affected my entire family massively. He couldn't even speak — I used to miss talking to him and listening to his advice. It was during this time at college that I used to weigh 95 kgs. I also had these white spots all over my skin, but I never paid too much attention to my outer appearance until people around me made me think about it. My parents have never ridiculed me — they only asked me to be careful for health reasons, but I was body shamed only for my outer appearance outside the house. 
I still remember it was Ganpati Visarjan and one of my colleagues looked at me and said, 'what are you doing here…isn't your Visarjan happening there?' and people laughed at his joke, but I felt so hurt. I tried to lose weight by joining a yoga class, but the teacher there said - 'first lose weight and then come back…you won't be able to do these advance Asanas.' 
I feel that at every stage, people enjoy reminding you of your flaws and somehow their validation is important for us — it was for me too. I went through having low confidence and feeling conscious of everything about me. I started travelling a lot around this time — I would take solo trips just to discover things about myself and help me gain a new perspective. It was during a trip to Hampi that I sprained my leg and had to be rushed to a hospital in Banglore. The doctor's told me that my weight would be an issue for my leg, my bones could become weaker and it would become very painful for me to walk. 
I decided to take this seriously and over the next one and a half years did everything in my power to lose weight, eat right and become healthy. My friends and family were so supportive and encouraging and before I even realised, I had lost 20 kgs. It was then that I realised, that the weight would come and go but how I felt about myself shouldn't waver based on how I look physically or what people have to say. The most important part of my journey was the fact that I wanted to lose weight for myself; to be healthy. I stopped allowing others to validate how beautiful I felt. I started honing my passions. Ofcourse I'm a foodie — so I started cooking once a week 'healthy' dinners at home for my friends and eventually moved to having food stalls and participating in culinary events. I love outdoor yoga — so every single day I workout in that form because I enjoy it…and yes, I can do all the difficult Asanas. In fact, I even train people on my own! I absolutely love my job and I don't think I've been more comfortable in my skin. I'm not skinny from any angle, but I feel beautiful on every level and once you start feeling that way, others see it in you too. People have stopped body shaming me because it would fall upon deaf years — in fact, I keep receiving compliments about looking good because I've stopped searching for validation — I finally found it within me.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/618919598317021/?type=3,2017-03-07 23:56:45,6690,171,318,5538,1098,53,0,1,0

Since then I've sold books and flowers at the signal because I don't want to see my mother go to sleep hungry ever again. 
I realised slowly that I can't spend my whole life selling things at the signal and the only way to move forward was to try and educate myself.  I joined Signal Shaala and started attending classes for the first time in my life at the age of 16.  I work 8 hours a day at the signal, attend school for 4 hours and then go home and do my homework.  It's ironic that I've sold books all my life but I couldn't even read the titles.  Now, late into the night I'm trying to read more than just a few pages of these books…and I can't explain the feeling of finally understanding letters and words.  Someday I dream of becoming a teacher — I dream of the day when there are no children working at signals, but they're all in classrooms where they can finally dare to dream.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/615993388609642/?type=3,2017-03-01 23:26:57,26810,345,1904,21751,4581,403,4,71,0

When we got a computer at home — I became obsessed.  My passion grew from playing computer games like Vice City to understanding the hardware of the system.  My father became worried when he saw me being on the computer for hours on end— he tried putting a password but by the end of the day I had figured out a way to bypass it.  Eventually he moved from being annoyed to impressed and ended up buying me a new system!  Whenever our system needed fixing, I would watch the expert closely and within a few short weeks I had networked two computers myself.  If there was any machine that needed fixing, my neighbours would come to me— and I was so young!
Given that I was so consumed by this world of computers…I failed the 8th standard.  I just didn't understand History and Geography.  Instead of yelling at me, my parents took me to the park after being called to the Principal's office and asked me why — I just told them that my life was understanding computers…the software and hardware and nothing else mattered to me. 
Eventually they allowed me to drop out of school but that doesn't mean I stopped learning.  In fact, my learning grew three fold! I started with small projects — fixing computers and cleaning up software and at the age of 19, I received my first big cheque of 60,000 Rupees.  I used everything I had saved to invest in my own company - TAC Security Solutions.
The best way to describe my professional title would be to call me an ethical hacker.  I would hack people's systems, so that they could see the flaw in them and take over their cyber security. I'm currently the IT advisor to the Punjab State and have held training sessions for the CBI, Punjab State and Crime Branch.  Our clients vary from Reliance to Government officials and we've recently expanded to have offices in 4 cities in India and 1 in Dubai.  At 23, my dream is to build a billion dollar Cyber Security company and I think I'm here today because when I failed, my parent's didn't scream or force me to take more tuitions — they understood me and let me be.  I'm not saying education isn't important — all I'm saying is how you choose to learn can vary and that failing at school, doesn't mean you're a failure.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/614651878743793/?type=3,2017-02-26 23:27:48,20954,771,2301,17859,2141,947,6,1,0

188056068070045_611706155705032,"""How many times have you seen a child at the signal, selling something or relentlessly begging? How many times have you felt annoyed…maybe sorry and given him some food or money and felt like you made some sort of a difference?  My grandfather was a freedom fighter, my father was a farmer and growing up there were so many financial difficulties that my education was heavily compromised.  Still, I was a stubborn boy and I used to do anything to get my hand on a book and read under street lights — so much of my time was spent in libraries and old book stores.  I was then sent to stay with my uncle to attend a school near his house and that's how I finished my basic education and landed a job with a book company in Maharashtra.  I used to read for a living and write as a passion and after two years of writing for myself I finally got a job as a journalist. 
Coming back to the question I asked earlier — it used to hurt me to see children at these signals — I don't know why but somewhere I saw myself in them.  I remember this one time, I was on my way to work, late for a meeting, drinking water from a bottle that was now warm when a small boy came to me to sell our Indian flag.  I looked at my bottle which was warm from just sitting in the car — what would the condition of this young boy be?  The fact that he was selling our flag hit me and I knew that I wanted to desperately do something…anything to try and rectify the situation. 
That day I began my research on the life of these street children — we conducted surveys, spoke to these children, their families and then made contact with several government bodies across the city. We also found out that the Municipal Corporation was working towards trying and sending these children at signals to BMC schools, but since years there wasn't any progress. 
After many failed meetings in between endless efforts to come to a mutual conclusion we finally decided to take the school to the children, as opposed to the other way round.
We started Signal Shaala in an empty ship container near a signal.  Our next task was to get these children to actually come here to learn.  It wasn't easy —these families are below the poverty line and their kids start working as soon as they start walking. These kids make around 100 rupees a day by selling things. 
Slowly, we convinced parents to allow them to do both and our small team set to work.  We started making the environment colourful and taught students through games, quizzes and interactive activities. Slowly, we shifted to more organised classes and gave them notebooks and bags which they cherish.  
We have about 28 children today, studying out of a ship container but with big dreams.  Just the other day, this boy who comes to school borrowed 300 Rupees from me, because his father is in jail and told me he would return it soon.  I didn't expect him to, but he went to Kurla, bought books, sold them and paid me back almost immediately and said, 'thank you for teaching me…thank you for giving me hope that I don't end up like my father' and that to me was everything.  The hope, the courage and the stubbornness of an educated mind.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/611706155705032/?type=3,2017-02-20 08:09:14,5929,119,525,4616,1115,193,1,4,0

188056068070045_610715765804071,"""I was born in a small village called Litania near Nashik.  We had only one primary school in our village and the only available profession for men was farming but since I was young I wanted to be a part of the government. It actually was a really funny incident — once when I was young and I saw an aeroplane in the sky, I asked my mother who owns these planes and she randomly said 'the government' and since then thats what I wanted to be a part of. I used to study night and day and stood first in the SSC board exams. After that I got into college which was 23 kilometres away for me, but I didn't miss a day. Despite getting 86% , I lost admission at the only college we had in our village by 1 mark and that's when my father told me it was time for me to give up studying and become a farmer. 
At the age of 16, I was a full fledged farmer but because of a dispute with my dad I decided to give revisit my dream of studying further. I borrowed 350 Rupees from my mother and enrolled myself in a distance learning programme. While I was still working hard on the field, I was studying night after night to get my degree.  At 18, I had completed my graduation for a total amount of 1250 Rupees and I had cleared my Police Service exam and the combined defence exam as well.  in 1987, at the age of 22 I was selected for the post of Assistant Commissioner — it was the happiest day of my life.
Even after I got the position, I never stopped studying — I've held many positions all over the country.  My biggest case so far has been the 1993 bomb blast — we were working 18 hours a day, everyday and I still remember interviewing a terrorist called Faki Ali.  We had tried everything to break him, but he refused to open his mouth.  It was during this time that I had completed my distance learning course in psychology.  I don't know what hit me then, but I just calmly went to him and said if he didn't start talking, we were going to bring his entire family to the station to watch him suffer.  His behaviour shifted and within 10 minutes he had given us the location of where 30,000 rounds of AK47 bullets, hand granites and guns were located.  That incident just proved to me that in order to grow you have to keep learning.
In 2000 I became an IPS officer — from being a farmer and spending not a Rupee over 1250 — I became an IPS officer.  I've build schools in my village, set up a dream housing society for 10,000 constables and spoken at the United Nations — all because I had a dream.  Receiving Vanshree award and Indira Priyadarshini award made me feel overwhelmed. Pursuing commando course in US was altogether a lifetime experience.
So many times people complain about policemen, but what they don't realise is that we're doing our job.  We give up spending time at our own homes and celebrate every festival on the street.  We're on call 24/7 and nothing comes above our duty.  I still remember when it was my brother-in-law's wedding and I was on my way there when I got a call to come in— I left that second.  It has been an honour to serve the people all these years— and I'll continue to do so.  My only message would be to chase that dream with so much passion, that there's no other choice but for it to come true— and it does...I'm the living proof of that.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/610715765804071/?type=3,2017-02-18 07:42:40,12830,408,1343,11036,1344,440,7,1,2

During that wedding we became really good friends and continued to meet pretty much everyday after. I don't know at what point our friendship became love…or maybe it always was love but there was never really a need for him to ask me to date him — we were already madly in love.  We were both working and at that time there were no cellphones — so we had one designated bus stop or a particular spot at the train station where the person who got done with work first would wait for the other.  From writing long letters to each other to sipping on hot tea in the rain…our old school romance was innocent but so pure. The best part of our relationship was that we never needed to use words to understand each other — even about our marriage.  He didn't need to ask me to marry him…the question was never 'will you?' The question was 'when should we?'
""We got married in 1982 and started building our life from scratch.  We moved out on our own and were financially independent from day1.  We were both working around the clock to pay the bills and make ends meet. It was during this period of struggle that we realised that the one thing that kept us going was our relationship.  When the hours were long and work was demanding the thought of my wife waiting at home for dinner is what pushed me.  She pushed me to work harder, to be a better version of myself and the life we have right now has been created by both of us together.  From wanting to educate our children at the best of schools to moving to bigger spaces we've achieved everything together.  In 1999, we both began to discuss the prospect of starting a business but neither of us were sure of taking the risk of quitting a well paying job.  Over time, I realised just how passionate she was about running a business so I encouraged her to quit and told her not to worry about the finances. That was the best decision because over the next 6 years she grew our Logistics business idea from strength to strength and eventually in 2005 I left my job and we both worked on our business together!
""Our lives became comfortable from there and with our children being well settled we had the freedom to travel a lot more.  We were taking 2 or 3 trips a year, but we wanted to spend more time together.  It was around this time that we stumbled upon a post on Facebook about a couple who travelled by car from Bangalore to Paris in 111 days and we fell in love with the idea! We immediately started planning our trip and within a few weeks we had mapped out our route from Bombay to London and back — a 8 month road trip across 52 countries.  And what a trip it was — we've visited places that are so remote and unknown but have so much soul in them, eaten the most delicious local food and met some of the best people on the way.  At 55 and 61 we were discovering the world together but by the end of it we rediscovered ourselves and our entire relationship.  From re- visiting old memories to fighting like children our dash cam has seen it all.  Honestly we've felt a rollercoaster of emotions during this trip but the one emotion that stayed is love.  In the little things he did — putting my comfort above his, making sure that I eat well and bundling me up with that extra blanket when it got cold. Isn't that what it's about?  Not so much about the destination but the little things, the journey there and knowing that you have someone to unconditionally share it all with.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/608392209369760/?type=3,2017-02-14 00:07:04,23225,1773,3129,16429,6330,452,9,4,1

After finishing my work at home, I was always interested in learning embroidery from others around me, but never considered it as a profession because my husband was earning well.  
After the 2001 Bhuj earthquake my life changed drastically.  My home was completely destroyed and even though my children helped us set up a new home, I had to start working but I didn't enjoy even a minute of it.  First I was working as domestic help from house to house and later on I started helping my husband on the field.  It was around this time that I learnt that there was a centre where ladies can sit together and embroider and get paid for their products — I immediately went to this centre and enrolled.  From toiling in the field, I was finally able to do what I love at the Welspun centre —and the group of five ladies I enrolled with have become my closest friends. 
What happens in a male dominated village when the husband retires is that the wife is expected to take his place and work in the fields, breed cattle and manage the home.  I was excited to do something I love and make a decent amount from it.  I've even attended workshops to learn new kinds of embroidery and the day the centre came to our village to tell us that some of us would be going to Bombay to display our work was one of the happiest days of my life.  At first, I was scared if I would even be able to step out of my village…all my life has been spent here.  I also wondered if people would make fun of me — Bombay is so modern and fast paced… but my husband encouraged me a lot and told me that I absolutely had to go. 
I still can't believe I'm here; in Bombay by myself displaying my work at Spaces Kala Ghoda stall! I feel confident and empowered. So many people have bought things and women from Bombay have told me that I've inspired them — I don't think I've ever been happier.  At first I was hesitant to leave my husband, but then I realized that I'm doing this for the both of us. Marriage is give and take. He's earned for our family for so many years and today when he is unable to work, I want to stand by him and work for both of us. 
At 50, I started a new chapter in my life. I wake up in the morning, cook food and then go to my work. This is new me — I love my life, my friends and the fact that everyday I have something to look forward to.""

Growing up, the one regret I had was not being able to listen to Cartoon Network when my cousins were watching TV and laughing.  My interest in cartoons stemmed from there — I used to sketch cartoons, make my own stories in my head and laugh. I completed my animation course from Hellen Keller where I met some amazing people — my best friend cannot see, but the two of us have the strongest bond and have no problem communicating.  In fact, he's such a funny chap that he makes jokes about how we have the most complicated friendship in the world— He can't see and I can't listen to him! Funny thing is it's easy to communicate with everyone at Hellen Keller but sometimes it's a struggle to talk to normal people — I can't explain it.  Through this whole journey my biggest achievement was to stand first in my entire grade at Raheja college — and it was when I stood first that so many people realised I couldn't even hear!  I felt my father's words had come true -- I have no limitations and that was the biggest validation for me.  I no longer think I have a disability — I feel normal in my space.

188056068070045_595848437290804,"I spent my entire first year of junior college interning at a youth run organization called IIMUN, that organizes MUN conferences all over India. The year I was working there, they started with their International conferences, and their first one was in Bangladesh. The department heads had to give their best intern as a Chair for Bangladesh and when I was told it was me, I felt like at least someone thought that I was good enough to be one of the people to set the tone for their work in a foreign country. I had never felt that proud of myself. 
The rest of my family thought a little differently. They were worried about my safety and how I wouldn't be welcome. While I tried to understand where they were coming from, I never agreed to it because I hated the entire concept of stereotyping an entire country based on religion or what we've heard. Most people who haven't visited India think it's filled with snake charmers…so I didn't want to cloud my judgement. After a lot of fighting and crying, I finally convinced them to let me go and I couldn't have had a better experience.
I was the youngest member of our team and chaired 15 delegates.  Most of them were first time delegates so they had to learn from scratch but if you read the way they had written their articles, you never would've guessed that it was their debut into the MUN world.
After the conference was over, each one of my delegates hugged me and thanked me for easing their fears and allowing them to break their nervousness.
Even the organizing council from Bangladesh couldn't have been more hospitable to us. I remember on the second day I had a problem with the shoes that I was wearing and there were about three students who had taken it on themselves to find me a temporary replacement. There wasn't a moment when they were just sitting around doing nothing—they were so helpful.
Those three days reinstated my belief that we cannot ever judge someone or something unless we have encountered it ourselves.
A few months after I came back from Bangladesh, there was an attack on a restaurant in the diplomatic zone of Dhaka and my entire family had one reaction ""See, what if this would've happened when you were there?""
The funny thing here is that if I had asked to go to USA or France nobody would've stopped me because they're western countries that are considered safe and protected. Events like the 9/11 attack or the Paris attack get so much media coverage only because people think that these countries are invincible. But what people don't realize is that you can protect yourself from the known, but how are you going to shield yourself from the unknown?
This mentality is something that needs to change because if something bad is going to happen, it can happen anywhere - if a Nun can get raped in America, how is anyone going to guarantee my protection over there? When there are so many unsolved murder and kidnapping cases that go unsolved in India itself every year, how can anyone assure me that that I am a 100% safe here?
It's time we stop living in fear and do the safe thing — that's how terror wins.  It's time we stop confusing religion and terrorism — they're never one and the same thing.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/595848437290804/?type=3,2017-01-20 09:45:53,6292,140,355,5605,601,84,2,0,0

I've always loved to balance being a doctor and traveling — since the beginning I've loved being a part of different cultures and experiencing different lives.  
Recently, I've had two very different experiences.  The first was amazing — it was the Nigerian wedding of my sister. The family she's married into was so warm and hospitable.  They were so welcoming and accepting of all of us that it was probably one of the best experiences of my life.  The second was something terrible — just before our flight to Delhi, we spent a night in Warsaw at a hostel managed by a few Ukrainian guys.  During the night there was a nationalist attack on these guys by some hooligans from Poland without any valid reason.  There was so much mess that left me scared and ashamed.  It made me realise that Europeans are being more and more nationalistic without even realising it and that's not good for the world.  
Both my experiences were so different and involved different cultures coming together — the only difference is one was with love and the other was with hate.

We began dating when we were kids, so we've pretty much grown up together.  We've been through every phase you can imagine — from I love you, to I hate you, to I want to be with you all the time to I can't stand your existence!  I remember this one time when we were 17 and he got me a coupon to get my photos taken and this other time when he got me a heart shaped frame and there I was thinking wow, he's so thoughtful…but it was only much later that I found out that those were all the free things his aunts had sent to his house and he had happily 'gifted' to me. 
Another incident I remember, is right before he was leaving for University.  I used to always ask him to write a letter to me, or a few promises to me which he really meant and he obviously never wrote anything. But the day before he left, he wrote me a 5 page A4 size letter…and I was so moved…I don't think I could have written a letter that long!  Long distance was obviously terrible…but in the long run it really helped us — If you last so much distance, time difference and all those fights — you can survive anything.  We used to fight about so many stupid things — he was over possessive as if I was some Pamela Anderson sitting in Bombay!
After he got back from college and we were still dating…my dad kind of asked him about the future and where it was headed and that's when for the first time in years we decided to not talk for at least a month to get some clarity.  That plan didn't work out too well, because after a week he called my dad and said, 'I want to marry your daughter can you please come over to meet my parents' and I guess that was it.

In fact, the two of us together learned the sign language because my father in law has had a hearing impairment all his life.  But now, so many times when we're outside with people and we want to say something to each other, or crack a lame joke we'll do it in sign language…maybe that's what keeps the spark alive.

I learn a lot from him -- about loving selflessly or being happy by just being around the ones you love...everything is so unconditional, it's amazing!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/586383891570592/?type=3,2016-12-30 08:15:53,13392,575,492,10675,2686,18,13,0,0
188056068070045_586255828250065,"''I started to fall in love with him after a certain period of time. When he proposed again I said yes. We got married in 2011. I met him while I was volunteering at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Amsterdam. He seemed friendly and through the Organization he got my phone number. He texted me and every now and then we kept in touch. In 2010 he was in Amsterdam and he came by my house. To my surprise he asked me to marry him. I barely knew him so I kindly refused. But he kept sending me messages and kept traveling to Amsterdam to come and meet me. He made me feel special and he was very nice to me. At some point I was in love and he took good care of me. ''
The day we got married everything changed. Our wedding was big and many people were invited. I noticed a change in his behaviour. He acted differently but I couldn't really pinpoint what it was. After the party he left and he disappeared for our wedding night. He slowly changed from a loving man into a dominant husband. Before we got married he would tell me I was beautiful and give me compliments but once we were married he told me I dressed terribly and slowly started tarring down my confidence. I love meeting new people but he made sure I didn't become friends with his friends. He would tell me they were using drugs or that they were cheating on their wives. That way he made sure I didn't mingle with his friends. Later on I found out that he would tell his friends that I was an abusive wife and that I only married him for his money.
Every time he would be abusive he would tell me the next day that he was sorry and that it was all his fault. He promised me he would change. I kept giving him chances, but a man who beats you once will beat you again. In April we went on a family vacation to Dubai and when we returned he went back to India. I called him the next day but didn't hear from him in days and when he did pick up his phone he said he was busy. A few days later he had written my brother and friends and said that I was going to pay for this and that he was going to shame my name and would tell everyone what a terrible woman I was. From that day he made our lives impossible.
After 3 years of marriage I got pregnant. When I gave birth to Insiya, he left me alone with the baby. 6 weeks after our daughter was born the traveling back and forth started again but it was almost impossible. Traveling with a newborn is exhausting and by the time she was 6 months old we had traveled to India over 6 times. I was taking care of our daughter alone. He never fed or changed her diaper. I felt like a single mother in a marriage. After we got married he also became physically violent.
Even after what he had done I still wanted Insiya to be able to have a relationship with her father. One day he came over and while she was sitting on his lap he said that he would send his friends over to have me killed.  He said that he would kidnap our daughter and that he would take her to India. When judge decided that I became the primary and legal custodian of our daughter. It damaged his ego and as a response he started telling people that I was mistreating our daughter. I was scared all the time.
One day during my absence few men had come to my mother's house pretending they were working for the municipality and were government officials.  When one of the strange men saw Insiya, he grabbed her and took her to his car. When I got home Insiya was already gone. Ever since that day my life has been a complete nightmare. For two weeks after the violent kidnap, I had no idea where Insiya was. As far as I know she in Mumbai with her father who she barely knows. He has said that if I will go to India he will have me arrested. He is a wealthy and powerful man and he easily buys people off. He has hired one of the best lawyer of The Netherlands to defend him. I haven't talked to my daughter since she has been kidnapped. Despite my countless efforts, he will not let me talk to my 2 year old daughter. Together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Dutch government we are trying our utmost best to get Insiya back. Every day from morning until night I am working on this. I will not stop until I can hold my daughter again. I want to hold Insiya in my arms and never let her go. I wake up at night and it hurts so much to not have her near me. She used to sleep hugging me every night. Who will my baby hug now?''

I used to live on junk food without a care in the world, until at the age of 15 I ended up getting a cholesterol stone in my gall bladder and that experience opened my eyes to how badly I was treating my body.  It was such a painful experience; even after my surgery I was constantly on painkillers when I decided that I needed to make a change.  Everyday was a struggle from there — giving up junk food, controlling what I was eating, working out so that I no longer had the identity of being just a 'fat guy.'  I didn't lose weight overnight, but that process is what made me who I am today.
I went on to become an engineer, but I didn't feel passionately about anything as much as I did about fitness and working out.  From being a junk food addict, I had become obsessed with being healthy and watching videos of the greats like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  There comes a point in life where you have to decide what is it you want the rest of your life to be like and for me it was the thing that made my eyes light up and made me look forward to Mondays.  I may not be earning as much as an engineer but being immersed in body building, powerlifting and training people to lose weight makes me the happiest.  I have my own blog and a YouTube channel and I love documenting my fitness journey — I'm so happy, I literally wake up everyday with the biggest smile because I love what I do that much!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/585974648278183/?type=3,2016-12-29 07:36:20,10591,371,226,9718,748,121,3,0,1

We were in seventh grade and I didn't want him to drop out so I told him to continue and that I would figure something out.  I didn't have any extra money either but I knew that I have no choice and had to find a solution. Our school was 5km away and I used to get some money for travelling which was the only mode of money for me. I started walking to school everyday to save money for him and paid his fees in instalments.  That's a childhood memory I can never forget and my urge to help people started since then.
32 years back I met a lady who was looking for some help for her mother who was suffering from cancer. She was the only one in the family and had asked for help to accompany them to Tata hospital. I had never been to Tata hospital before and looked for it and after going there due to insufficient funds we told her to take her mother to the BMC hospital. During this time I had to go to Tata hospital quite a few times for her reports, thats when I saw 5 buildings of Tata hospital. I felt terrible after I saw that one of the buildings had a general ward and realised that the old lady's treatment would have been better there. I apologised to the old lady's daughter but she said ' please don't, you are my God! All the doctors had told me that we'll lose my mother but you're the only one who supported us and she's still alive because of that'. It was that one line that made me start Jeevan Jyot — an NGO to help cancer patients. 
Cancer patients from all over India come to Tata hospital and since they don't have money or any relative here they used to sleep on the footpath and eat Vadapav everyday. Once a patient's brother was down with severe stomach pain and doctors found out that for weeks he used to only eat vada pav, because that was all he could afford . At times he used to save money and only eat one Vadapav the whole day which completely ruined his system.  Since then I made sure that patient's family members get some decent healthy meal at Jeevan Jyot and today around 700 people get two meals daily here.  9 years ago I shut my restaurant and got involved with Jeevan Jyot full time because the happiness I get from knowing that someone's life has been saved because of me is priceless.  Ultimately everyone dies… you can't take anything with you when you leave…but the impact you create in your time here goes far beyond your years.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/585146001694381/?type=3,2016-12-27 08:58:22,13230,253,988,11041,1901,275,6,7,0

188056068070045_582198258655822,"The building I grew up in had 2 dogs and every evening I'd look forward to playing with them more than anything else.  I'd buy them packets of biscuits and feed them every single day as well. 
My love for animals began when I was really young and obviously I wanted a pet, but my grandparents didn't approve of it as they thought our house wasn't big enough for a dog.  So I made best friends with our building dogs Dumbo and Chhotu since I was 2 years old.  At the age of 5 I learnt the meaning of the word 'vet' and ever since then that's all I wanted to be.
When I was in my junior college Dumbo was diagnosed with ascites and had about 2 months to live and those were the toughest 2 months of my life so far.  He passed away mid December 2009 and a month later, Chhotu who was about 16, injured his leg and his health started deteriorating. I used to volunteer with an animal welfare NGO where I actively took part in on street first aid for stray animals. I did the little I could for him, and finally moved him to the shelter so he could be taken better care of. In a span of 3 days he passed away too. Suddenly the entire place felt so empty.  I didn't know how to deal with it and unlike most people who refrain from any further animal attachments after losing a pet, I knew I needed to get a new baby to fill that void in my life. Within 5 days I went and adopted CJ, my son, now 7 years old-- the one around who my whole life revolves around.
It was at this point that I decided to become a vet.  I couldn't bear to ever be in that helpless position ever again where I'd have a sick and dying animal in front of me and I couldn't do anything about it. 
I started school in 2011 and through the whole process I've worked closely with strays.  Every time I learnt something new in class I would stop on the road whenever I saw a stray dog and examine him to make sure he wasn't suffering. I've worked on almost every animal since then and I'm currently in the process of collecting funds to shelter my strays -- they suffer so much cruelty that it breaks my heart.  I'm working hard everyday to create a world where they aren't voiceless...where they can just co-exist.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/582198258655822/?type=3,2016-12-20 09:08:13,13844,476,623,11135,2544,161,1,3,0

It's so weird that we're drastically different but always on the same page.  We think platonic friendships are really underrated.  If you have a friend that knows you, understands you, gives you space but is clingy to the point of annoying at times-- you don't need to fill any void in your life.  That's really all you need at times -- conversations with your best friend about love, the universe and everything in between, or just a really sad movie that makes you cry together.

Life is very ironical at times — all my life I've been surrounded by children, but after marriage I had several miscarriages and then delivered a still born.  That was the hardest phase of my life, but finally I gave birth to my twins, prematurely but they grew up to be healthy and happy. 
In 1998, after my aerobics class I felt a kind of pain in my breast, but shrugged it off thinking it was a muscle pull.  A few days later I felt two lumps and realised that it wasn't just any pain…I rushed to the doctor immediately and got my tests done.  I tested positive for breast cancer and almost immediately had to get surgery.  I still remember, on the way back after my surgery was complete, I gave my husband a fist pump and said 'we'll be okay' even though the doctor had just told me I had 25% chances of survival.  How exactly should I put this in words?  That feeling of knowing that you may not live to see another day or get to see your children grow up and become parents themselves was overwhelming.  Through this whole time, I didn't once ask, 'why me?' — I didn't indulge in any form of self pity.  My whole life focus shifted from being sad to becoming a fighter. There were days that I cried, but for every tear I shed I fought harder.  I forced myself to laugh, to distract my mind and enable myself — very often I would fight with the hospital staff if they tried to help me go to the loo…even though I would fall on the way I made sure I did it on my own.
Long story short, I beat cancer but in 2004, I was detected once again. I underwent multiple chemo sessions and lost all my hair but I distinctly remember not giving it too much energy.  I didn't have any hair on my eyebrows so I would color them in with a brown pencil.  My nails would turn black so I would paint them a new color everyday to make me happy.  I would experiment with different wigs and love my look…there were times when I went out completely bald and people asked me if I had just visited Tirupathi and I would play along!  My whole life became about being happy no matter what my situation and the fundamental rule of life is — a disease cannot exist in a body that has positive energy.  I beat cancer, again and this time I came back with a thumping victory.  I began to counsel cancer patients ever since, because for me defeating it twice wasn't enough— I wanted to defeat it as many times as I possibly can. 
The only thing that's different about me now is that I often ask the question, 'why me?' just so that I can say the answer out loud — 'because I'm strong enough to handle anything that life throws at me…and because I already have!""

I used to have this 12 hour work day for years until I got married.  It was an arranged marriage, but even though I felt less of a responsibility I never quit my job. I continued to work with ICICI bank and made my way up the ranks as time went by.  We were blessed with two children, and I loved bringing them up and teaching them the things I learnt while growing up.

During Diwali, my mother took me to visit a cancer hospital for children to celebrate with them and that experience changed my perspective on life.  The one thing I felt was guilt — I complained about so many insignificant things, but there were people in the world who didn't have anything, who maybe wouldn't live to see another day but they were so content and happy.
I began to regularly visit Dr. Ernest Borges Memorial Home and a little boy named Aditya gave me a new life purpose.  Aditya was the biggest cricket fan — My mother and I spoke to his mother and got to know more about the struggle of this boy who was my age but going through so much.  After chemotherapy, when Aditya felt emotional and drained, cricket was the only thing that sparked some energy in him.  No matter how tired he was, if there was a match going on he would run to town and stand outside a barber's shop all day, watching the screen from outside.  His only dream was to experience a cricket match live.  This was around the same time The IPL was coming to an end, when we realised we could actually make Aditya's dream come true.  We arranged for 2 VIP tickets and surprised him on the day of the match — the thrill on his face is something I can never forget.   He was on his feet throughout the match…clapping, cheering and going completely crazy.  Not only was the match a memorable experience for him, but he said that he had never before seen or eaten that much food in his life and that statement was a real eye opener for me. 
Since then, I've been committed to raising money for underprivileged children suffering from cancer through the Nargis Dutt foundation.  In the past 3 and a half months I have raised 7.8 Lac Rupees and this is just a drop in the ocean for the amount that's actually needed to help these children.  
My only message today would to be to children my age who are affording. We don't blink an eyelid before buying 4 Play Station Games a month or buying expensive gadgets.  I'm not saying that's bad, but the next time maybe buy one game less and contribute that small amount to charity — it could literally save a life!
We're lucky — we can go to school and take all the financials for granted, but what about these kids whose parents have no money because of expensive treatments?  These kids have a right to go to school, learn, play and have a normal childhood…just like us.

I fell in love with the place — the culture, the people, the city.  I mean I have so much to learn, so much to discover about food, it's ridiculous.  And it's the people who've made the most impact on me — they're beautiful, inside out.  One of the boys who works with me in the kitchen watches English movies, just so that he can learn English and become a Chef — and he does it with a huge smile on his face…where else can you find that?
For the first time in my life, I have no plan but to be happy. I love working at the cafe-- I want to cook, I want to experience life and just be for a while.  There were times when I could cook for 18-19 hours a day without eating myself but coming here has put so much into perspective — I mean I am literally the most thrilled to eat a plate of Pani Puri at any point in the day!
So I guess, the lists don't always work out and the plans don't always fall into place…but there's always something else.  From France to Bombay, from thinking I know everything about cooking to feeling like I know nothing at all…I've learnt just one thing — sometimes the best things happen when you aren't planning…sometimes, they happen in between all the check lists.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/576474102561571/?type=3,2016-12-08 08:46:21,9435,367,495,8167,1189,75,4,0,0
188056068070045_575969505945364,"""After my daughter got married, she took my sickly son along with her because her husband and she could give him opportunities I couldn't. She's extremely bright and her husband is the kindest son-in-law I could hope for. However, I'm a widow and suddenly I began to feel the slivers of loneliness slip into my daily life. I now had more free time than I could handle, no husband, no children and no job. 
I love children more than anything else in this world. They're untarnished by the cruelty of this world and I suppose that is why I am so drawn to them. I knew that I had to be around children, so I took a job as a caretaker for an Indian Administrative Service (I.A.S.) officer's 4 children. I started working in 2002, and up until 2009 my job was effortless. The children were kind and I enjoyed cooking for them and walking them to school every day. 
Suddenly in 2009, things began to change. The officer stopped paying me. While it was a problem, I wasn't too worried because I was living with the family and had food and shelter provided. I loved the kids so much that I didn't think much of not being paid a salary. As long as I had a roof and food, I was satisfied with my life. 
But soon, the I.A.S. officer began drinking. One day after getting drunk he attempted to sexually assault me. I was so shocked and embarrassed by it, I didn't know what to do. He was an I.A.S. officer. Who would take my word over his? He persisted with this kind of behaviour for days. At times he would even drug me and have his way with me. I sincerely hope no woman has to face the horrors I did. 
When I finally decided to leave, he created a scene by bringing his four crying children in front of me and asking me who would take care of them if I left. His wife no longer lived with him. Looking at those innocent faces that were so petrified of their drunk father, I decided to stay, just until I could make sure the kids were safe. 
When I continued with my demand to leave, he started emotionally manipulating me into staying. Because he refused me pay, I had no money to go out and start afresh. When the abuse became unbearable, I told him I will find a way out somehow. That led him to make a decision that would impact my life forever. 
 
One day after dropping his children off to school, I was walking back home. That's when I noticed a bike appear out of nowhere. I recognized one of the persons on the bike was the I.A.S. officer's driver. I smiled and looked to him to wave hello. But in an instant, he threw a bucket full of acid all over my face. Initially it felt warm, but within seconds it felt like burning sulphur. My screams echoed through the streets. I thought I would faint from the pain. I thought I was dying. Fortunately, a woman came and poured water over me. The damage however, was done. I was left with scars on my face and body.
While I was in the hospital, the I.A.S. officer put a guard outside my room under the pretext of protecting me. It was to make sure that I don't mention he was involved in the attack. This guard would record my every day conversations with my doctors and nurses and report to the officer. 
When I recovered and told him I would file a report against him, he changed his phone number. He also had his men threaten me whenever I would arrive at his house. He began ignoring my messages, calls and pleas for an explanation. I finally filed a report. I'm glad that the law took its course and I got justice eventually. Today, he and his driver are in prison. 
I wish more than anything the officer's little children are alright. I don't know where they are or who is taking care of them but I know that no matter what – they are better off, away from that monster. 
I refuse to let this incident define me. During my recovery, I spent enough time with my son and daughter to know that I need to fill my life with love, people and most of all a sense of independence. I now feel stronger than ever and am excited to build a new life. I often wondered how I would find a job again because I was so afraid to trust people, but Make Love Not Scars showed me just how much kindness still remains in this world. I want to be a babysitter so I can be around children once again. That's why I'm a part of the #SkillsNotScars campaign for employing acid attack survivors, I now know that everything I've ever dreamed of is within my grasp.

I realize now that my parents were right most of the times. I've made mistakes and I wish, looking back that I had listened to them. I wish I had tried to understand my mother a little bit better.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/575947185947596/?type=3,2016-12-07 08:09:59,5087,77,143,4813,246,3,18,7,0
188056068070045_575547419320906,"""Like most Indian women I had an arranged marriage. I didn't want to get married but I had no say in the matter. So I went along with it hoping for the best. But it didn't take long for the man I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with to show me his true colours.
From the beginning he was physically and emotionally abusive. He started drinking and kept increasing the amount of abuse over the years. He would lock me in my room, beat me, strangle me and then sexually abuse me. He would force my parents to pay for things he wanted and if they couldn't afford it, he would take his anger out on me. He even threatened to sell me into the sex trade. I believed him because he had sold his previous two wives into the trade.
When I became pregnant, I decided that the best option would be to abort the fetus before he hurts my child. My mother agreed but he found out somehow and put a case on us. I was forced to carry my son to term. I believed that since he fought so hard to make sure that I gave birth to our son, he must surely want him. I believed he wanted to be a good father to him.
But I was wrong. He wished to use my son to get to me. He stopped letting me see my son and demanded a ridiculous sum of Rs.50,000 to let me see him. I would beg to see my son because I didn't have that much money. Those days were some of the darkest days of my life.
On the night of 21st August 2010, while I was sleeping in my family home, my husband crept into the house with my son's milk bottle filled with acid and emptied it all over my face. I woke up screaming in agony. My mother tried washing the acid off but the damage was already done. I lost my left eye. 
My scars will never go, I can live with that. But I can't live with not knowing where my son is. My husband took my son away with him and till today I do not know where he is. The police say there's nothing they can do until I locate my son. 
Today I'm alive only to see my son once again. I hope to become independent and influential. So that one day I can bring my ex-husband to justice and hold my son in my arms once more. I often look at little children and wonder what my son looks like now, how old he would be and what sort of games he'd be playing. These thoughts never stop. 
Through Make Love Not Scars, I want to come closer to that vision. My dream is to be a beautician. Before I would often hide my scars, but now I've embraced myself as I am. I want to make every person I encounter feel beautiful, confident and strong in their own skin. I'm hopeful that as a beautician, I can make people happy in my own little way. As a part of the #SkillsNotScars initiative, I want to find a job, earn a living and gain the means to find my son.

She was married to an abusive man, and at the age of 19 she was pregnant with me but even though my parents got separated she had to fight for my custody for 6 long years. Even though she won custody almost 4 years ago, the passport office refuses to make my passport , as she is a single parent. She has gone to the passport office over a hundred times, but no one seems to listen to her, they keep harassing her for more papers even though her paperwork is upto mark. I'm 10 years old, and because I don't have a passport, I haven't been able to travel anywhere...even though I so badly want to go to see different places.
The government needs to change the rules for single parents. My mother has taken care of everything for me since I was born, but the passport office still demands the father's permission. Why is his permission needed, when he's never been my father in the first place?  All these years, we've just been harassed by him...while he has remarried, has other children and travels the world whenever he feels like. It doesn't matter anymore I don't know him and I don't want to know him, but he continues to impact our lives negatively.

188056068070045_574542316088083,"""I've always been a homemaker while my husband worked at the railway station.  We were very content with our lives— I was very happy raising my two daughters at home and he used to love his job. Suddenly one year, I fell really ill and I was hospitalised for a couple of months when we faced some difficulty managing everything, so my husband called his mother from our village to look after me here.  After a few months when I recovered and my mother in law was leaving to return to Patna my husband went alone to drop her off at the station, sometime around 9PM.  I was sleeping when my sister in-law called me around 10 PM, told me about the attacks and said my husband wasn't answering his phone.  I rushed down to the PCO to call him and after trying many times someone finally picked up and said, 'the person who's phone this is, is dead… come claim the body' and I was shattered.  I had no idea what to do or where to go, so I sat down on the floor and cried. 
It took me many months to recover — from seeing his body to realising that I had lost my partner forever.  As time went by,  I pulled myself together — I had to.  I had two daughters who had their whole lives in front of them and I had to make sure that I did everything I could to educate them better.  I received compensation from the government which I used for their education and to take care of the house and my mother.  I was also offered a job from the railway, but since I had only studied until the 8th grade, I couldn't get a job that paid me half as well, but I took it anyway.  I wanted to set a better example for my daughters, so after a few months I decided to join school again.  Those days were absolutely crazy, from preparing food for my daughters, dropping them to school, going to work, coming home, cooking dinner, doing my homework and rushing to night school at 7 PM…I have no idea where the strength came from!  I just loved that I was educating myself to never feel helpless again — I finally passed my 10th grade exam and am on my way to clearing my 12th and through this time I got my promotion as well!
I know my husband would have been proud of me…of us — my daughters are doing so well at school.  Sometimes, life takes people away…I still sometimes question why 26/11 had to ever happen, but the only way to fight back is to not give up.  Every year, that day marks the death anniversary of my partner, but it also remains the day I became independent, where I didn't succumb to the terror but used the pain to make my girls and me stronger.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/574542316088083/?type=3,2016-12-04 08:13:07,19490,423,1278,16121,2682,514,5,168,0
188056068070045_573615629514085,"""Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated by business men. I would throw questions at every small business owner in my hometown in an attempt to understand what made their businesses tick. Business for me is so much more than a means of living. The more business owners I interacted with, the more I realized how much our nation depends on such entrepreneurs.
As I grew older, I dedicated my time to my father's business, only to move on to work in the insurance industry. I also worked as a team leader in a couple of corporations. This allowed me to gain vast experience and skills in fields completely unrelated to each other. Having acquired these skills, I always dreamed of leaving my sheltered hometown and going to a big city to pursue my career.
One day, I was overseeing operations at my father's factory in Meerut. That's when I noticed a man sitting outside the factory, whistling and catcalling women walking by. I questioned the man angrily and asked him to stop, only to hear him laugh mockingly. He told me he was Chintu, the Landlord's son. He also warned me that my misconduct would cost me dearly. I recited the whole incident to his father and said that I was going to file a complaint against Chintu. His father pleaded me to let it go and assured me that Chintu will cause no trouble in the future. 
The very same day, as I was closing the factory, Chintu ambushed me with four men and told me that I had invited trouble. I ignored it and started walking towards my house. When I reached home, I noticed that Chintu was at my doorstep with four men. Fearing trouble, I ran away from there. I heard Chintu's laughter, he yelled out ""How far will you run?""
 I managed to escape and reached home a little later. I called my family for advice, they told me to wait till they were back in town. Two days later, I realised I was being followed while I was on my bike. I halted after taking a turn. I noticed Chintu standing some distance away. He had a bucket full of concentrated acid in his hand. Before I could react, Chintu threw the contents of the bucket at my face. Within seconds, my hands, thighs, ears and chest felt as though they were on fire. I've never screamed like I screamed that day. Luckily, my brother was able to rush to my rescue. He quickly took me home before Chintu could cause more damage. Later we discovered that Chintu had planned to throw another bucket of acid on me.
 After the attack I was depressed for months. But I knew that my dreams were still out there to be conquered. I pressed on and finished my MBA through correspondence from Amity University in Delhi and worked as a team leader at Amar Ujaala. I kept myself involved with my father's business and negotiated decisive tender contracts in the insurance and steel industry. I continued to break barriers with a belief that I could accomplish anything I set my sights on. I got married to a beautiful woman who loves me and embraces who I am. She never lets me hide my scars because she believes that they are a tribute to my strength. She's given me a beautiful baby daughter that I love more than anything in the world. 
With the love showered on me by Make Love Not Scars, I am now looking to find employment in a big city through their #SkillsNotScars campaign.
Not only is my attacker still roaming freely in my hometown, but he continues to threaten my family. By moving to a different place, I can make sure that my daughter grows up in a safe environment where she can play, dance, study, sing and achieve whatever she wants in life.

188056068070045_573054306236884,"""I grew up in a small middle class family where everyone around me was either a doctor or an engineer.  I have always been overweight, and a huge part of my childhood revolved around trying to be funny as a defence mechanism.  I loved being the class clown, the kid who everyone referred to as funny.   Growing up, I was obsessed with Johnny Lever to the point where I would tape over his voice and crack his jokes for over an hour with ease.  On the 26th of January when I was in the 7th Grade, there was a building function going on and I mustered up the courage to ask the organisers to give me 5 minutes on stage.  I told them I couldn't dance, or do kart wheels but I would make people laugh.  I went on and for 20 minutes straight released all the Johnny Lever jokes within me…and I basically slayed.  You could say that my first tryst with comedy stemmed from way back then. 
My parents were concerned with my weight for health reasons, so when I was in the 8th standard they bought me a cycle at home and motivated me to lose 5 kgs in 6 months.  That was a significant incident in my life because even though I had no pressure from my parents, it was an admission of a huge flaw.  I remember cycling and weeping because that's when I thought If I couldn't even lose 5kgs, what was I really capable of?  But like they say, from your biggest adversity comes the biggest opportunity — after that I was never the same again.  I worked my ass off— my numbers were perfect — I topped my school and my college and became obsessed with making something of myself and proving a point.  
I gave up trying to become a marine engineer and focussed on my biggest passion — comedy.  I have gone to every festival — from Malhar to everything else just to perform and get on stage.  I have written, performed and have been part of events where I've been the only performer because no one else applied.  At 18, I've written for Mumbai Mirror and by the age of 25 I had written over 15 television shows — I worked fucking hard. 
Then I remember my first legit stand up happened when Kavi Shastri advised me to talk about who I am— for 20 minutes I joked about what it's like to be fat and people loved it and I loved the applause — it was like a drug like nothing else and I think that's when I decided I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.  
So very honestly, when people troll me for being fat on twitter I actually reply saying, 'thank you' because if I wasn't fat I would have never worked this hard.   I say thank you because I have an entire career because of it.  I say thank you, because if it wasn't for those jokes,  I wouldn't have had that much anger in me to go out there and kill it.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/573054306236884/?type=3,2016-12-01 08:59:09,28601,571,1350,24916,3234,421,24,4,2
188056068070045_572491562959825,"""As a thirteen year old, my life was filled with happiness. I had a loving family, great friends and an exciting life at school. I was always surrounded by hugs, sweets and books. I believed no harm would ever come my way.
 One day, when my elder sister and I were walking to school, we noticed a 25-year-old man following us. Initially, we ignored him but he then started pestering us by throwing things at us. When he persisted with this same behaviour for days, we decided to tell our brother about it. He went over to the man's house and informed his parents about his behaviour.
 
Some time passed and we completely forgot about the incident. One night, while my sister and I were sleeping in our room, the man who used to stalk us, sneaked into our house. He barged into my room and poured acid all over my sister and me. I woke up screaming in pain. Most of the acid landed on my face and upper body. Fortunately for my sister, the acid only harmed her stomach, her face was unharmed.
 My pain was unbearable. My mother rushed me to the local hospital. The doctor there felt there was no chance that I would live. However, she refused to give up. She took me to Delhi for better treatment,  but no hospital in Delhi was ready to admit me. So she contacted a minister for help. He requested a renowned doctor to look into my case. It was this doctor who helped restore my eyesight and gave me the courage to continue to fight.
As a result of the attack my facial features became indistinguishable, but I was still hopeful that my condition would improve. In 2015, I underwent a life changing operation, which restored the skin around my eye.
It has now been 20 years since my attack took place. During this time, I came across Make Love Not Scars and am now part of their #SkillsnotScars initiative to become independent.  I want to be a part of this society...your society where these scars don't hold me back.  The only way to fight back, is to take away from what they believe-- that once acid is thrown on someones face, their life is permanently ruined and society will never accept us again. 
Will you accept me? Will you help me feel normal again?

""I was forced to marry at the age of ten. And at the age of fifteen, I moved in with my husband and in-laws. Slowly, I learnt to love him. He was kind and treated me well. But after I gave birth to my first daughter he changed. He'd just take one look at her and get uncontrollably angry. I could no longer recognise the man I had married. He'd turned into a violent and abusive husband who frequently demanded a son. 
When I became pregnant again, he said we could be in love again, only if I could give him a son. When he found out I was carrying a girl child, he began punching my stomach furiously. He then smashed my head against the wall and said that he would kill the fetus. My brother tried to convince me to leave him, but I believed I could make things better. My brother and I lost contact as a result of my decision and things only got worse when I gave birth. 
When my eldest daughter was seven, my husband and in-laws poisoned my food. I fainted and woke up to find the left side of my face covered with acid. The pain was indescribable. My in-laws and husband took me to the hospital and claimed I fell on a stove. I hadn't. They'd thrown acid on me. With no money and no family, I continued to stay with my husband. I had no choice. I couldn't leave my daughters behind in such an abusive home. 
I was attacked with acid again. This time on Karvachauth. After the horrific abuse, I was denied water and food for days. I was attacked with acid for the third time in 2015.This time my whole back was charred from the poison. I continue to live with my family because where else could I go? No one wants to hire a physically scarred woman that comes with two young children. 
Things are getting better now. I continue to fight. I work as a part time dishwasher and the job pays me Rs. 600 a month. While it's not a lot, it gives me hope. I connected with Make Love Not Scarswho are now funding a series of surgeries for me and are giving me a new voice. I'm also part of their #SkillsNotScars campaign in the hope that they can help me find a more permanent job.  With a steady job and income, I will be able to finally leave my nightmare behind and give my daughters the life they deserve.

188056068070045_571359863072995,"""Growing up, I never thought of myself as brave or strong. In fact, I would run out of the room at the sight of a needle. I hated visiting hospitals, hated looking at medical apparatus and hoped I never ever have to visit the operation theatre. I couldn't even handle the smallest of injuries. 
At the age 18, I faced one of the cruelest and most painful acts a person has to go through. My neighbour, a young boy constantly harassed me by proposing marriage every time he saw me. He threatened to kill my father if I didn't say yes. I didn't make much of it and decided to just ignore him.
One day when I was working in the kitchen, he snuck up from behind me and splashed concentrated acid on my face. I started shrieking with pain. My father, who was some distance away, immediately came running to see me lying on the floor, writhing in pain. After driving the boy out of the house, he rushed to the police station to file a complaint. It wasn't until 10 o'clock that night that I was taken to hospital, six hours after the attack. It was too late for doctors to do anything, by then most of my face became disfigured.
You're probably thinking this is where it all ends for me. No, I didn't let that happen. I moved to Delhi and had over 40 surgeries performed on me. I got in touch with Make Love Not Scars, they helped me find my lost confidence. I felt motivated. I then went on to complete my 10th and 12th standard education. I took a class in basic computers. I made and sold carry bags out of recycled newspaper. And even  I overcame my fear of hospitals and worked as an O.P.D. registrar at a hospital!
Today, I no longer see myself as a fragile young girl. I'm ready to reclaim my life. I want to work and make a living for me and my family.

188056068070045_569404709935177,"""I was married to the love of my life, an army man who I had two beautiful children with. I used to be a journalist and travelled with him to the places he was posted and later took up teaching as a profession once my children were born. In 2000, he passed away from a brain haemorrhage and life as I knew it came to a stand still.  I didn't think I would ever love again and I was okay with that— my world narrowed down to my kids and I was happy.  In 2004, my mother surfaced the idea of a re-marriage and asked me to meet someone she had in mind. I took my time and decided to meet him, if nothing to get a friend out of the situation, but when I did meet him he was so kind, compassionate and caring that I couldn't help but meeting him multiple times. He had lost his wife to cancer and had three children, so we were both in the same situation — our conversations lasted for hours, because someone else was finally going through the same thing.  I realised that after everything, I could still feel, and I felt for him— I fell in love again. 
We got married 12 years ago and initially it took some getting used to.  His children didn't fully accept me and would call me 'masi' and my children called him 'uncle'.  Slowly, as time went by I started becoming their friend and an incident I'll never forget is on the day of his daughter's wedding.  Her mother- in- law asked her to start calling her 'mom' instead of aunty and she immediately turned back, looked at me and said, 'you've been a mother to me for so many years and I've called you aunty— please, can I call you mom?"" and I don't think I've ever been happier in my life— we had finally accepted each other. 
These past 12 years have been beautiful — we've traveled the world together and watched our family grown.  We've also made our own customs and traditions — every year on his wife's and my husband's birthday we cut a cake and on both their death anniversaries we go to the temple to pay our respects. 
As a family our love has grown over 13 years with our 5 children and 3 grandchildren…we're all going away to Lonavala this weekend…it's going to be absolute madness! As for the two of us — we continue to be best friends and each other's secret keepers.  We also continue to date; in fact, we're on one right now— he has a very romantic night planned ahead… I can't wait to see what it is!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/569404709935177/?type=3,2016-11-24 08:00:23,26132,719,1112,21414,4329,368,9,11,1
188056068070045_568834699992178,"""I was overweight while growing up and faced a lot of bullying throughout my childhood.  Since birth, I've been unable to hear so there were a lot of times when I didn't even know when people were making fun of me, but there were times when the boys in my class would come close and say nasty things and that's when I knew that I was being bullied.  Since then, I withdrew and had very few friends.  I would get very frustrated at myself, but my mother was always my biggest support.  She used to tell me, 'people will always try and pull you down…but that just means you're already above them!' and that's what kept me going for the longest time. 
At 17, my world changed once again — my mother passed away and it was at this point that I found it difficult to cope with life.  For months, I didn't do anything but there came a point when I had to get out of it and make something of myself…make her proud.  It was around this time that I began to work out, and as time passed I knew that I wanted to become the fittest version of myself.   I pushed myself to run, swim and work out at the gym every single day for 3 years and I went from 145 kgs to 70kgs.  From being bullied about being overweight,  I'm on the way to my first modelling assignment next month and it's all because my family didn't allow me to give up.  My mother may not be here, but her words still guide me and I wish she could have been here to see my transformation…I hope I've made her proud.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/568834699992178/?type=3,2016-11-22 23:51:47,19511,492,517,16757,2301,426,6,20,1
188056068070045_567723563436625,"""My father was a freedom fighter,  and my whole life I've wanted to be like him— to make a difference for my country.  Even though I'm a certified doctor, my heart always longed to serve the country. 
A major event that happened early on in my life was meeting my partner — I found my entire world in one person.   What started off as an innocent attraction turned into a lifelong bond — at 18 we knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together and our parents didn't approve so we set out on our own since then.  
He knew that I wanted to empower myself and do something for the country so as a stepping stone, he began to train me in martial arts.  We would go to work all day and at night train until sunrise…with every passing day I felt more independent and powerful.  I wanted to become a commando trainer and I was so determined that I trained harder than ever before.
Once, when my husband and I were in Pune we passed a group of army men who were training in the morning.  We approached them, told them who we were and asked them if they would like us to demonstrate our form of training and they agreed.  Since then, we haven't looked back.  We began to train army personnel all over the country and I became India's first woman commander trainer.  
As time went by and my commitment to this cause grew,  my in-laws disapproved of me, the woman of the house undergoing such intense training and one day asked us to leave their home.  My husband and I moved into this small clinic space, which is the only place we had at that but this is something that brought us even closer together. Those were difficult days— I've sold a lot of my jewellery to make ends meet but I have absolutely no regrets.  I spent most of my youth in freezing high altitudes, scorching hot deserts, dense jungles and hostile LOCs and I loved every minute of it.  
It was sometime then that the conversation of starting a family came up, and after many healthy conversations my husband and I decided to adopt.  I was at the peak of my career and I didn't even want to stop for a second, so this way we could balance our work and the child without having to give anything up.  We adopted our little girl, who is now a doctor and what can I say…she makes us proud every single day.
So while I am a doctor, I pride myself on the fact that since the past 20 years I have trained without any compensation over 20,000 Indian soldiers from every elite force including the NSG BlackCats, IAF Guards, Indian Navy Marcos, BSF and many more.  In fact, after the 26/11 attacks, I was called in to train the police of 16 cities.  There have been many lows in my life — on the family front, on the health front — I've been injured multiple times and on the financial front as well…but I didn't stop.  
Often I hear that we live in a male dominated society, but I have never let my gender come in the way of what I wanted to achieve.  My husband and I have always been equals and that's why we're so strong -- from work to family we're equally invested in both.  As a society, that's how we evolve -- by having strong, independent women who are supported by strong, independent men as equals -- two halves who can take on the world together.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/567723563436625/?type=3,2016-11-20 07:47:41,15235,465,1603,12300,2347,586,0,1,1
188056068070045_566514693557512,"""I always knew I had different preferences,  but throughout my childhood I silenced myself and pretended to be someone else.  When my friends at school spoke about girls I felt uncomfortable.  When I was sexually attracted to a boy at 14,  I tried my best to subdue it.  I began to spend more time reading online, wondering if maybe I wasn't the only one…and I wasn't!  It still took me 3 years to 'come out' to my parents— and they were devastated.  Over the next few years, we grew apart but I was determined to show them my world and at 21, I made my first gay themed short film, 'Logging Out'.  I won an international award for it,  but after watching that movie,  the distance between my parents and me completely disappeared.  We began to have healthy discussions about LGBT rights and when my relatives started bad mouthing me,  I didn't even need to say anything-- my parents defended me the whole way.  I've organised a number of Gay Pride Parades, and my mother recently walked with a placard that read, 'I am proud of my Gay Child'! — and that was the best feeling in the world!""
""How have your relationships been so far?""
""When I was 20, I lost my boyfriend in a car accident and that was a really difficult time for me.  Since then there have been relationships, but for now I'm focusing on my career and the cause.""
""What's the dream?""
""In a few years, I see myself marrying a good man in front of my family and friends in the traditional Indian way, hopefully.  We'll adopt children and a stray dog and grow old together…that's the dream.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/566514693557512/?type=3,2016-11-17 08:20:16,14072,347,452,11606,2317,142,3,1,3
188056068070045_565677673641214,"""I'm the manager at a bank.  On 8th November, I was working a bit late when my husband called me and said, 'how did you not tell me that 500 and 1000 Rupee notes are getting scraped' and I was shell shocked.  None of us had any idea what was going on…we just knew it was huge.  So we went into work the next day, preparing for the days to come but no amount of preparation could fully prepare us for what was coming.
People's view of the whole situation was limited to the lines they saw outside the bank, but what was happening behind closed doors was entirely different.  We became a part of the dirty cycle that runs in this country.  On one end there were chaiwallas, istriwallas who were queuing up to deposit their hard earned money but on the other end we were receiving black money that had been stashed away for years and all this cash smelled like rotten leather to the point where every one of our branches ordered masks for the cashiers — that's how unbearable the stench became!  From fights breaking out and the police intervening to educated people storming our offices and violently asking us for money — we've dealt with it all.  
Just the other day a builder who's had an account with us for many years, came forward to finally pay us an amount that he had defaulted on a Non Performing Asset.  When we had chased him for months to pay up, he had defaulted but all of a sudden he came forward!  He has over 300 crores in black money, but before this he claimed to have none at all — that's how dirty the business is. 
Don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining about what has happened — it's a revolutionary move that will only strengthen our country and I completely understand what the common man is going through as well, but what can we possibly do?  There's only so much cash we have, and only so many people who can attend to such a large population.  
What's ridiculous is how people are behaving— they're treating us so badly.  Just 4 hours ago I received a call from a man from a place called Nanded who screamed at me non-stop.  He went on yelling, blaming me, cursing in Marathi and I'm sitting there just wondering what I could possibly do and we've received dozens of such calls each day.  Not just that, but the threats have also come.  We get calls from people who are politically endowed and threaten to 'send media to expose us' or to 'create a scene' if we don't move money — I mean when will we learn?  We're bankers — there's only so much we can do!  We've hardly slept these past few days, we're not taking any weekends off…in fact most of us haven't even exchanged our own 500 Rupee notes because we're trying to help others first.  
Our banks are losing money on interest and there's already enough chaos…do we really need to add to it? We're all in the same situation, we just need to sit tight and understand that steps are being taken to aid the process — this is for the future of our country and the least we can all do at a time like this is have patience and believe that everything will stabilise soon.  And for heaven's sake, stop trying to use more corrupt methods to get out of an already corrupt situation…we don't need any more of it!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/565677673641214/?type=3,2016-11-15 08:31:53,37393,1286,12142,35157,1161,167,13,840,55

188056068070045_564728283736153,"""I was a student of Wilson college.  During my first year itself I was part of a managing committee and we had to elect the secretary of our committee.  There were two candidates, one Maharashtrian and one Gujarati running against each other, and because I was Maharashtrian everyone assumed I'd vote for the Maharashtrian candidate.  Instead, I voted for the Gujarati candidate because I thought he deserved my vote and was more capable then anyone else.  That little vote of mine created quite a stir and I still remember the day when a meeting was called and that particular candidate insulted me in front of everyone calling me a traitor and blaming his loss on me!  That didn't sit right with me at all, so instead of being shunned, I marched into the principal's cabin and told him how disappointed I was that our college was being divided based on our religious communities.  I said we were all students, where did the question of religion come in? He immediately summoned him to his office and asked him to explain himself, at which point he apologised to me, but I was not okay with just that.  He insulted me in front of everyone, so he had to apologise to me in front of those people as well…and that's exactly what he did. 
Through this whole time,  that Gujarati candidate and I ended up spending a lot of time together because the principal would call us all to his office, or we had to explain ourselves to different groups of people.  Even after this whole controversy died down, we used to meet and he was such a gentleman— I fell for him.  I remember him telling me, 'you stood up for something when you were so new to college, you're so principled and fiercely independent…it was hard not to fall in love with you!""
""What's your happiest memory together?""
""There have been many since then ofcourse, we've been married for 62 now but I think our dating days are irreplaceable.  Back then, we didn't have a lot of extra money to spend…so we would wait a long time to watch one film, share a bucket of popcorn and then he would walk me home after.  Even when we didn't have money we would go to the beach or hanging gardens…but the thrill of spending those few hours with him is something I can't even explain!""
""What has been the key to your relationship?""
""There has never been any ego… it has always been about love first.  Giving up a few things, compromising or making adjustments are such small things when compared to love and that's what these last 62 years have been about— knowing that love is bigger than everything else.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/564728283736153/?type=3,2016-11-13 06:33:52,17814,627,1129,14018,3576,213,5,1,1

188056068070045_562867697255545,"""I started working since I was 7 years old.  I would walk 6 kilometres to get to school in the morning and from there go straight to work on a piece of farmland in my village, Manekpore.  I always wanted to make something of myself, so even after such a tiring day I would study all night under an oil lamp-- the only form of electricity we had back then.
One day, I was working in the field where I saw an aeroplane above me and that's when I decided that I wanted to become a pilot...ofcourse I didn't know what it was called back then, but I just knew with all my heart that I would get there.  At the time, my father was working in Bombay as a peon so I decided to leave my village and get to the city to fulfil my dreams.  Life in Bombay was difficult -- we lived in a small slum and money was tight again so I would study and work simultaneously.  I was desperate to learn more about aviation, but almost every book was written in English, which I didn't understand.  To learn english I would watch movies at 90paise per show, save money to buy second hand books and became a member of every other library.  From oil lamps, I began to study under street lights -- I've lost count of the number of aviation books I read in those days. 
Finally, I was selected in the Bombay Flying Club for my practical flight training but I was refused admission because my father was a peon.  Instead of being heartbroken, I put in all my effort to pay the fees of 2lacs for a commercial pilot license.  I have knocked on every door for financial assistance, persistently approached every government body and charitable trust for help and wrote thousands of letters explaining my situation.  Finally, the Chief Minister of Gujarat helped me out and within a few months I was in the US-- studying at an Aviation Training Inc Hayward, California, working part time and building my dream -- I couldn't believe how everything had fallen into place!  I still remember that day in 1989 when I became a pilot instructor-- me, the boy from a small village in Gujarat!  I decided to return to India almost immediately after, to give back to my country.
I knew that I didn't want others to struggle the way I had to fulfil my dreams, so I set up my own Aviation School, The Skyline Aviation Club.  It started with one small classroom setup where I conducted training workshops...and today it's a full blown academy -- we've trained over 4000 commercial pilots in the country.  
As for me, my love for flying continues to grow.  Infact, my wife is a student pilot as well!   We often fly over my village, where I can still see the plot of land where I used to work for 25paise!  Recently, I was able to purchase that piece of land -- I wanted it because it reminds me of my roots...where I come from.  It also helps me live my motto everyday-- 'keep your eyes on the stars,  but your feet firmly to the ground.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/562867697255545/?type=3,2016-11-09 08:24:38,9423,333,825,7888,1118,411,4,2,0

I still remember, my mother, younger sister and I were staying in a small cottage with a huge garden, cuddling together at night, talking about a bright future.  At the time, there was a lot of tension around our house — property disputes and stuff like that…but my mother never let it affect us.  My mother led by example — she is the most hard working woman I know and she raised my sister and I to be fierce and independent.  Since then, I dreamed of owning a house under my name for my family and that's what kept me motivated.
Growing up, I always wanted to be on stage.  Whether it was singing, dancing or hosting — I just loved the thrill of performing in front of an audience.  Whichever event was happening in school or college I would be the first to sign up!  I was always motivated, always interested and always hungry for more — what more can I do?  What other challenge can I take up on?  My ambition was fuelled by my desire to help my mother out — she was a single mother, raising two girls, working full time and she motivated me to nurture my ambition. 
When I was in college, I was part of a band, doing voice overs on the side, juggling college and still finding the time to sing, dance, perform in a Hindi play and handle the Radio for Malhar— and I loved every single minute of it!  It was somewhere around the same time that Private Radio Stations were making a comeback and I heard of the auditions 94.6 was holding…immediately I jumped at the opportunity.  I went in for audition thinking, I've done Radio at Malhar…how different could this be? And I ended up nailing it!  Even though it shut down a couple of years later,  Red FM offered me the job at 93.5 and the rest as they say is history!
Looking back,  I think that a HUGE part of success comes from just being present to receive opportunities and take them as soon as they show!
It's been over 10 years since that first audition and it continues to thrill me everyday, that people all over the city actually listen to me early in the morning!  More than anything, I think I continue to be overwhelmed by the impact I'm able to create — over the past few years we've raised 50 lacs for the National Association of the Blind,  30 lacs to sponsor the education of children from BMC schools and have 'Bajao for a Cause', where we do something different every year.  From getting Dharavi kids to perform for Amitabh Bachchan or getting artists together to perform for senior citizens in old age homes…it gives me goosebumps to think of the 'once in the lifetime' moments we have managed to create.  That's what it's about in the end right? How much you've given back? 
Today,  I'm still hungry for more.  What else can I talk about on my show to keep it relevant?  What other causes can I get involved in?  How many lives can we change together?  While the hunger to strive harder remains,  the dream of that little girl in the cottage has been fulfilled — just the way I'd imagined it.  My mother, sister and I staying in a home I was able to buy for us…so I guess I should end by saying that no dream is ever too big!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/562409060634742/?type=3,2016-11-08 08:56:23,11041,182,386,9764,1138,133,6,0,0

I had a great childhood — we had one of those old bungalows with a beautiful backyard where we spent so much of our time running around, playing catch and cook and eating family meals.  We shared a great bond with our neighbours,  a Muslim family who we spent most of our childhood days with.  In fact, we were the only Hindu family on the entire street — but back then, what difference did that make?
I used to love to read — I was always excited to go to school, study and in the future make something of myself.  I worked twice as hard for my board exams — I knew that those marks would determine which college I got into.  I still remember,  I had finished my revision for each subject twice before my boards started on the 8th of March 1947, but on the 6th of March 1947 — riots broke out and nothing was the same again.  All our exams were cancelled, the streets were empty and people were fleeing the place with whatever luggage they could manage.  I still remember the day when our neighbours came to our house and advised us to leave…they said it wasn't safe, the tension was rising and that they didn't want us to be harmed in anyway.  At the time,  my Masa was visiting from Jammu so my family decided to first send me away to my Masi in Jammu.  Times were horrible and when young girls were taken captive…one cannot even imagine the brutality they were subjected to. 
I left for Jammu, with a few of my belongings and no assurance of when I would see my family again.  When we got to Jammu, we got the news that trucks filled with dead bodies of Sikh or Muslim men were being sent across the border — it was a terrifying time.  Meanwhile, the tension around Jammu and Kashmir was also on a rise.  I remember,  everyday I would wake up and wear 4 pairs of clothing instead of 1 — just incase we had to run all of a sudden.  Our house there overlooked the valley, so we could easily see people approaching.  My Masa had prepared me that incase he saw that people were storming in and there was a chance that I would be taken captive — he would kill me first.  Everyday, I would see him sharpening knives and swords and I wondered if that day would be my last — it was worse than death itself.  
Around August, my masa, masi and I left from Jammu to get to Delhi.  Back then, there wasn't a direct train ride so we had to make our way on a Military bus that stopped for us and a luggage carrier to finally get to Agra.  The last we had heard, our family was in Delhi but we couldn't be sure because we hadn't heard from them for a while and our letters reached months later…or sometimes not at all.  It took us 8 days to get to Agra and those 8 days were the worst — we could barely sleep, eat, or talk and death was constantly looming over us.  
Thankfully, we were reunited with my family in Agra after all those months, but I was no longer the young girl who wanted to read, study and make something of her life — all I wanted to do then was to keep my family close and survive.  When people throw around the word 'war' I feel like telling them this story.  War changes everything — I lost my teenage years to it,  my education to it…my peace of mind to it.  It changes you…it makes you scared, angry and those haunting memories never leave you.  It displaces your family, turns you against people you've known and loved all your life and when everything is over… you realise that you're no longer afraid to die.  The fear of death is what makes us human but what's left after war is inhumanity because of everything you've seen or been through.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/561388180736830/?type=3,2016-11-06 06:31:52,13672,304,1837,10831,675,51,1,2109,5

I came to Bombay with that dream at the age of 20 and life has been a roller coaster ride since then.  I began to train people, somehow managed to bag a bollywood film and was on the verge of losing everything when I was bedridden for 16 months while shooting for the next!
From there, I nursed myself back to health, regained my fitness and represented India in various International Fitness programmes...and ended up becoming an entrepreneur as I opened my own chain of gyms in Goa.  
What I'm trying to say is, that I've never looked at anything as failure -- only as an experience and that's been the key to my life -- to not overthink things that don't work out but focus on my next step and the step after that.  It's one life, why waste even a second?  Think of it as an experience,  laugh about it and just move on!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/560840210791627/?type=3,2016-11-05 09:21:27,4216,88,121,3990,176,46,2,2,0

Even though I tried listening to him, I was only interested in cooking...when my mother used to cook I used to learn things from her but whenever I entered the kitchen my family would get annoyed.  They said that if I enter the kitchen then I will not be called a true man; that no girl will want to marry a man who is a house husband. 
Growing up, I always I wondered how a man entering the kitchen affects the male ego and a woman who works out of the house isn't considered 'marriage material and 'homely'.  As time went by, I realized that my passion for cooking would never die, so I left home set up my shop here.  Initially, it was very difficult for me to find other men who would join the business because of this very stigma and for many years I was a one man army -- but as time went by and people saw that I was making a lot of money they joined my team.  
Remember that saying of maa ke haath ka khaana? Funniest part is people who come to eat here often say they come here for chacha ke haath ka khaana -- and that's been the biggest compliment for me.  
To all those people who live in the stone age and still think that 'roti banana sirf aurat ka kaam nahi' -- let me tell you, this is the 26th year that I can make the most perfect, round rotis and no, that doesn't make me any less of a man.

Very often when we're there, a cricket match between India and Pakistan will be going on so we will all sit on one side of the hall and my mother's side sits on the other side.

Both of us are Thalassemia major patients, so every meet we would bump into each other and learn a little bit more about one another.  Through these meetings we became friends, more so because our problems and insecurities were so similar — for one, the both of us had given up on the idea of love.  Our condition is such that we have to get blood transfusions every 15 days and a 'long and happy life' is a very distant dream. 
As time passed and we let each other into our lives, I realised that I was in love with her. She filled a void in my life that I didn't even know existed before we met— and I knew that whatever little time  I have here, I wanted it to be with her.  On her birthday, I purposely didn't wish her.  Instead, in the afternoon I casually called her up and asked her to meet me at a place where I told her my friends and I were hanging out.  When she came to see me, she realised no one else was there and I had forgotten all about her birthday.  Just when she was about to leave I handed her a little box and when she opened it she wanted to kill me.  It had a huge capsicum in it, which she's allergic to — but then I opened it and inside was a beautiful pendant set for her… and she was so happy, it made everything worth it.  Through everything our parents were so supportive of our relationship and our treatments that it made us less stressed about what the future held for us. 
In a few years we were married, obviously knowing that we will never be able to have children of our own, but she's enough for me.  We still date — we go out for dinners, movies and now even our blood transfusions together.  We're both aware that we may not have a lot of time in our lives,  but we don't worry about that too much.

I had a growth in my windpipe called Papillomas and as a result I had to depend on an oxygen tank until I was 18.  After multiple surgeries I was able to breathe normally, but my voice was barely audible — until today I have to get a laser surgery every year, or else I lose my voice.
I am a homemaker.  I have two sons and a loving husband, but I've always felt like I need to do more and be more.  Many years ago we had only one car and my husband would take that car to work.  Whether it was dropping my children for school or tuitions or running my errands, I would always have to go in an auto…so I decided to start saving money for a bike.  Every month I would save a little, and after a year and a half I was able to purchase my own bike— and the second I drove it, I fell in love.  More than anything it gave me the independence to move around freely — it may not sound like a lot to you but it was everything to me.  
I joined a female motorcycle group, and saw that there was a group of women going to Goa on their bikes…I wondered if it would be appropriate for a homemaker to leave her kids and family and go out on a bike journey.  When I told my family about this opportunity they were so supportive — intact they pushed me to go for it!  My husband said he will make sure he's at home more and my older son said that he would take care of his younger brother.  I made their study time tables for them, organised their drops to school and tuition and took it — I went to Goa and back by bike with a group of women and it was the most liberating feeling of my life…and it had only just begun. 
Last year, I even completed a ride to Himachal and Uttarakhand but the highlight of my life has been when I got chosen to go to Khardung La by TVS Scooty Zest.  At first when I applied, I thought that from 50,000 applicants there was a slim chance, but I almost immediately got a call saying I was on board! 
The journey was a beautiful one — of course there was a lot of difficult terrain but it was all worth it when we got to the top on August 21st.  Infact, I turned 50 on that very day and the rest of my group organised a cake and sang for me on top of the peak. I remember the moment I reached the top— I started screaming! Never before had I felt so free, powerful and complete.  When I got to the top, I felt that I had my own identity… that I wasn't just someone's mother, or wife— I was ME.

---------
""We both grew up in Hyderabad, so I've known him since I was 7 or 8 years old maybe. He lived a little far off, but we would play together occasionally and always be present for each other's birthdays. We didn't tell each other that there were feelings -- but words weren't necessary. At 19 I went off to Cambridge in England to study English and we didn't speak for months...but we were both waiting to see each other.
I finished my education and had been home for some time, when one day I was sitting under a shady tree, reading in the afternoon when he drove in. I thought he was there to see me, but he saw me and marched straight into my house. After a few minutes, when he came out, I asked him what he was doing. He replied, 'I just went in to ask your father if I could marry you and he said the decision was yours...so If I may propose to you, will you please be my wife?' -- of course I said yes! A few months later he went off to fight in the World War II in Burma and those years were the most difficult. We could only communicate through letters-- all of which reached me months after he'd written them. I began to volunteer in the Indian Medical Service just to be close to the war. 
""Fighting the War was terrible...we were surviving on biscuits and preserved foods for years on end. War was brutal and ugly. The worst part was leaving my wife behind...I was young and so much in love that each day was like a lifetime. Leave came in bits and pieces so I barely saw her but I wrote her letters expressing my love for her but they couldn't do justice to how much I missed her. There was this one incident in the trenches where I thought I would be shredded to pieces - in fact the reason I'm alive is because a bullet hit my riffle and bounced off it. In those moments I could only think of her and how desperately I wanted to survive to meet her.
When the war finally ended and I was going to meet her at the Guwahati station, my hair had fallen out and I had this yellowish skin-- I wondered if she would still even love me. But when I saw her, she embraced me and said, 'you've never looked more handsome.'
I came back and decided to leave the army, because I couldn't fight against my brothers who I'd trained with...who had saved my life on occasions -- just because they were part of Pakistan. After 16 years in the army, I left and started a new life in a new India with my wife...and it's been a beautiful journey. I'm 99, she's 98 but it still feels like yesterday that we played our first game of catch and cook together -- oh how I love her and what a life it's been!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/553150554893926/?type=3,2016-10-21 09:00:37,10219,448,859,7141,2241,32,5,798,2

Starting Monday, we're looking to begin our book drive all across the city of Bombay to collect books for LEISURE reading for children from BMC schools.  Our mission is to enable BMC schools across the city to have functional little libraries, which they currently lack.
These children sometimes cannot even afford text books… reading books for leisure is a distant dream.  Thanks to our sponsors Big Happy City and our Implementation partners, Teach For India — we're able to do something about it.  Our Books on Wheels Team will not only collect books from across the city, but will be stepping into these schools, to educate children on book manners, how to look up words in a dictionary, making fun book clubs and book reviews… all to inculcate the habit of reading in a fun way!
This Diwali, share books from your childhood with us, so that an underprivileged child can experience the same thrill you felt, when you read those books for the first time!  
Let's do this together — Let's collect 10,000 books (in relatively good condition) for children from Grade 1 to Grade 10 and fill their childhood with a little more imagination :)

There was nothing wrong with the company, but I hated the monotony to the point where I was unhappy.  One morning, I woke up and quit.  I didn't really have a plan, but I knew I was passionate  about a lot of things like meeting new people, photography and sketching. I didn't want to be confined to a space… I wanted to be free so I purchased this auto rickshaw a few months later because I knew I would be able to meet all kinds of people and have the time to stimulate my creativity.  Ofcourse I worked hard — sometimes I worked more than 12 hours a day but I was thrilled — I was getting to see so many new people and learnt photography from studios all over Bombay.  
That was 40 years ago, and to some this profession is demeaning but to me it's the best job in the world.  I've combined my passions in so many ways — I click photos of my passengers, I write and paint.

In 2005, I was detected with breast cancer and I had to undergo 6 chemo sessions and 30 radiation cycles until I was finally cured.  I thought I had won the  cat and mouse game with cancer, but in 2013, when I started feeling increasingly nauseas and weak, I got an MRI done and realised that I had stage 4 brain cancer.  
I won't lie — At 62, when the doctor told us that I had 8 days to live, I was terrified.  I remember that night, lying in Bhatia hospital, processing the news… I didn't know if I would sleep. But then I visualised my guru, took his name, and said to him, 'from here on you are responsible for me.' Then I did, what most people find difficult to do — I let it go completely.  I stopped giving it any energy… I stopped making cancer bigger than me.  As I went through 20 sittings of brain radiation and one massive surgery after the other — I kept myself busy and amused.  Even when the doctors painted a bleak picture which consisted of possibilities of haemorrhage or paralysis I focused all my energy on the beauty of life.  I felt liberated. 
I still remember that I had lost 10 kgs, but when everyone was around me in the hospital, I would say - 'check out my muscles' and they would all burst out laughing.  My daughters were scared of telling me that I had a bald patch,  so when I went to the hairdresser to get a haircut and saw it for the first time — I burst out laughing and said 'oh God, now I have lesser hair than your father!'  
If they were my last 8 days here - I wanted to focus on the beauty of life and that's what I did— I lived every moment with love for my family and everything around me.  
My daughters and I started meditating to calm our minds, I started doing a lot of yoga, with a heart filled with faith prayed to my guru and moved onto a raw fruit and juice diet. The doctors had given me about 5 medicines to have three times a day and asked for tests every three months. My family would go through immense pain each time I would go for these tests so I made a resolve to become so fit that I was no longer a cause of pain to my family.
And it was with that resolve that today, I can do yoga for two hours each day, my weight has increased again, I walk for about half an hour, take no medicines whatsoever and feel happier and healthier than ever before.  In fact, I've even started teaching children at a wellness centre.

I was left in tears — they didn't even know if they would get to eat for days and here I was complaining.  That incident, made me desperate to help in any way I could.

I asked my mother how much it costed us to make 1 lantern — she said it was approximately 2 Rupees and that's when the idea struck me.  I started making these lanterns and selling them for 5 Rupees to my relatives and neighbours while my mother sold them to her colleagues at work.  Over the weeks, as I sold more lamps I saved enough money to buy all the children sweets for Diwali.  I don't know what it was, but seeing those children devour sweets that we take for granted made my Diwali more than special. 
From there, I began quilling and making envelopes, handicrafts, dolls and even themed sets.  In 2013, I had another experience which made me rethink how much we take for granted.  My mother was detected with breast cancer.  As she underwent treatment, I felt like my whole world came crashing down — but my mother was always so positive.  She told me were so lucky that we could afford the best treatment for her, and there were so many others who weren't as fortunate.  That was the second time where I felt gratitude but helplessness at the same time.  That year, I collected an additional 30,000 Rupees for cancer patients— and I know it might not be much, but I did whatever I could.  I'm conducting a workshop at Tata Memorial this Diwali, for children who have cancer…to make them play games and give them lots of sweets!  I'm 13 right now and I hope that every Diwali I can add a little more light, and bring a few more smiles.  Hopefully the day will come where no child goes to sleep hungry and everyone can afford medical treatments — I'm going to try and give it my all…and that's all we can do for now — try, until it becomes a reality.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/551702241705424/?type=3,2016-10-18 11:44:27,17751,402,1903,14344,2865,525,5,12,0

Sometimes, people like you will talk to me, atleast make me feel human and then there are others who come and scream at me because they're in a hurry and there's too much traffic. 
A few years ago, at around 12:30 am one night,  I noticed a young girl, not over 25 walking from the bus stop, possibly towards her home.  It was one of those dingy lanes where there aren't a lot of people.  I noticed her, because she looked very anxious and when I looked behind her I saw these 2-3 drunk fellows whistling, and calling her names.  They then began to actively chase her and I was still across the street -- so as a reflex I decided to start honking continuously.  The noise created enough alarm, because they were startled and immediately ran away in the other direction.  I crossed over, and told that girl that I would drop her home -- she was so terrified, she had gone completely pale.  We drove in silence for those 2-3 minutes....her house was just around the corner, but when she stepped outside, she caught both my hands, started weeping and thanked me over and over again.  Even though I said it's okay and that I would have done it for anyone, she insisted that I wait outside while she went in to get something.  She came out with a tin of rasgullas and told me to take them home to my family -- I thanked her and left.

The extra money will help her pay for her many medical tests and surgeries in the future.

The result? Prisca's operation was successful and she can see again! She has regained her vision entirely and is well on her way to recovering and going back to her children in Zimbabwe! 

We can't thank you enough for helping us, help her see the compassionate side of humanity which still triumphs.

Of course it was a struggle while growing up — other children making fun of me, not being given the same opportunity as them; whether it was wanting to be a boxer or participate in other tournaments. As I grew up, I began to accept my situation and would often joke about my 'missing limb'. I was also very determined as a child. 
I was always a huge fan of football, so I would train really hard to be a goal keeper and all that training paid off — I was selected to play at the Inter-school level. The first match of that tournament was an unforgettable one for me. When the coach of the opposite team realised that I was the goalkeeper, he declared that his team would win by 'atleast 6 goals!' but I didn't let that bother me. I was so focussed on doing my best that we ended up winning the game 4-2! That was a day of validation for me— that if I really try nothing is a limitation.
And that's what my entire adult life has been about — trying different things. I've worked at a call center, at a movie rental place, as a waiter at a hotel, as a hotel manager and even a brief stint in bartending! I began to travel a lot as well and when I was in Goa, I began to write poetry and sell my pieces for 6 months. As another experiment I worked as an AD for a film called Candy flip and thats when I fell in love with the profession. Ever since then, I've started my own company called 'Secret Locators', a post film production house and I'm living the life of my dreams!
In 2014, my cancer resurfaced in another form, but I beat it for the second time. Or like I usually say — 'my invisible hand is always showing the invisible finger to cancer!' Jokes apart, these things happen in life — it's how you deal with it. I prefer to take it with a pinch of salt and move on and I wish people would do the same and stop being sympathetic towards me — I'm not disabled, I'm differently-abled!

Ofcourse when I undertook training, it was difficult to convince my father that this is what I had decided to dedicate my life to. I knew I had a responsibility towards them, but I had blind faith that 'to the degree you surrender to God to that level he'll take care of your near and dear ones.' That's exactly what happened — both my brothers found their passion and their lives changed for the better; my father found his calling and my mother was happy. 
Through spreading this message, I feel that my family has grown to lacs of people. I share their pain, I share their happiness. I've visited so many homes in Bombay and the one thing common is that no one likes to share! Every person thinks that the other person is happy so let me not share why I'm unhappy but let me tell you this world is a 25Paise circus! 
The story goes, that in a village in India an announcement was made - 25paise only to the see the best circus; only catch being that people could only enter one by one. The morning of the circus came and the man who stood in line for many hours to make sure he was first entered the circus. When he entered he saw it was empty and there was only one big tall man present. When he asked this man, 'where is the circus?' he said - 'Ill show you!' and he beat the person up black and blue! When this man left the circus from the back side he thought to himself - 'let me not share this humiliation with anyone' — so he dusted himself and went to the other villagers waiting in line and said 'wow, what a great circus all of you must go and enjoy!' One by one all the villagers went into the tent and received the same treatment, but not one of them warned the others. At night when they all gathered at the village square, some spoke of clowns, others of elephants but no one said what actually happened. Every person felt bad that night because they all thought 'everyone else saw such great things, it was only I who suffered!' 
The point I'm trying to make is, we're all in this world together. Everyone goes through struggles and trials, why must we pretend? Why can't we accept that it's okay, and it's okay to share what we learnt with others so that we save them from the same pain we went through?"" The reason I'm sharing my experience is because I want to spread the message that you may be a doctor, an engineer or a lawyer — but if your calling is something else, you should accept that.

I had strange experiences — like one day after our class I was on my way to dinner and singing the Keerthana, entirely absorbed in the clear, starry sky when all of a sudden I felt a force move me from my path and place me across the bridge. I had no explaination but I was too happy to question it — It was only once I got to dinner that my friend told me the usual path we took to dinner was obstructed, and he had fallen down on those stones and injured himself. That's when I felt that the force was Krishna…I had deliberately been moved.
It's written in the Holy book that Krishna will fulfil all your material desires so things even started happening in that direction. First, of all places they could find, 2 army officers came to my college in Baramati to randomly interview and select 2 students for training and of course I was selected. When I reached Allahabad, I realised that I was in a different world; that I couldn't relate to anyone there — my biggest desire of becoming an army officer left me without warning…even though it was within my reach. 
I also had another attachment which came back into my life during this time. Somehow, through my prayer even that desire gradually left me. I realised then that I was given access to all my desires, but I myself didn't feel the need to reach for them. 
It was also during my college days that I had the most out of body, spiritual experience. One of the devotees sent me a box of books to read, and as I started to go through them it hit me that I had been to all those places before. I knew them, I recognised them and that was the moment it was all over for me. For the next 4 days, whenever I started chanting, the tears would just flow. I'm still waiting to relive those days.

At that age it's easier to find solace, so when one of the teachers at that army school told me that both Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan had been rejected from the same academy -- I began to think that maybe there was something else in store for me. 
I enrolled myself in a BSC course near Himachal, where I developed a new 'pass time' as you may call it. Every time I would see a book stall I would run to find books on mystic perfections -- the tantra, mantra of it all fascinated me. 
After this I applied to study Engineering, but somehow I only got a placement at a college in Baramati near Pune. It was kind of a village so I really wasn't that happy, but if I cleared all 10 of my subjects in the first year, I would be able to transfer out. I cleared 5 subjects in the first sem and again, I was fully prepared for everything in my second sem. For the Mathematics 2 paper, I had solved all the questions at least three times. Infact, the day before the exam I ended up teaching my roommate, because he was panicking about the paper. The next day, when I saw the question paper in front of me, I recognised each and every question but my mind drew a complete blank. In those three hours, I could only attempt 27 marks! Imagine my roommate passed the exam, but I didn't and that's why I couldn't transfer -- at that point I didn't have any idea what was going on.
But like I said, looking back I understand how everything was orchestrated. In my next semester, on my way to college I saw a blue coloured bus with the words ISKCON on it. I ran to it, to look for books of my interest but didn't find any. Disappointed, I went back to my college. The next day, an announcement was made that a seminar would take place 'The Secret to Happiness' and college would end early. All of us were thrilled -- we decided to skip the seminar and play cricket instead! On the way out I saw 2 Sadhus walking in -- one in saffron and the other in white and it was as if something was drawing me to them.

I was born in a small village in Himachal Pradesh, into an army family. My grandfather served in World War II and my father was an army man as well, so since the beginning my deepest desire was to become an army officer. Ofcourse, we would pray and chant, but nothing related to Krishna. However, since the time I was a young boy I would have a recurrent vision in my mind of wearing saffron coloured clothes and leaving home to become a sadhu— but I didn't pay any attention to it. 
I attended an army school in Jharkhand, and when I reached the 12th standard I prepared for my entrance exam to the NDA. In my entire schooling life I had been a topper and for these exams in particular I had over prepared. My father's seniors in the army had interviewed me, I had undergone intense training in Chandigarh and was confident that I would clear. 
Before the exam even started I knew one thing— the army officials didn't tolerate lies. It was okay if didn't know something, but if you lied about it — they wouldn't trust you and therefore not select you. My exam began and we had a number of tests… extempore, command tasks, group exam, psychological tests and a lot more — I excelled in all except the command task. I then had a formal interview where the army official interviewing me already had all my test results. He asked me the question, 'did you face any difficulties?'. I had undergone training, I knew I had to be honest but I replied saying 'no, I didn't face any difficulties' even though I had performed miserably in the command task. He asked me again, 'are you sure?' and I said 'yes, I'm sure'. 
I stepped out of that interview and all of a sudden it hit me…what had I done? It was as if I was in a trance and some unknown force was controlling me in that interview — and I only came back to my senses once I was out — I was devastated. 
After 2 days, there was a second round of interviews with 15-20 army officials from different boards and here comes the shocking part — the same man who had interviewed me earlier was present and again he asked me the same question — 'did you face any difficulties?' and involuntarily my answer was the same 'no'. Again, I had no control over this and I was rejected from the NDA. 
Back then, I had no explaination for this…I just wept for days to come because my biggest dream was taken away from me. Looking back now, I can connect the dots that this was all part of a much larger plan.""

It all started out in a funny manner — My friend and I would take a 11 Rupee bus ride every weekend to the NDA only because the food was much cheaper in their canteen! That's how we became friends but pretty soon he moved to the IMA to Dehradun and as an officer he was posted all over India. Believe it or not, the only way we kept in touch through the whole time was through letters. It was 2002 and cell phones had just come in, so we would write to each other about our days; about our lives. They were all innocent letters, but they were amazing because it gave me an insight into how simple he is as a person.
6 years went by like this, and finally after that he sent me an SMS saying - 'I really feel for you and I would like to be with you'— and at that point it all just fit. There was no over the top proposal, or exorbitant gesture…but there was love and stability. 
After marriage I moved with him to Bhatinda, where I was working as a lawyer from home. Those two and a half years that we were together were so special, but being a professional I knew that I couldn't move around every 2 years with him and some of the places he was posted the only job available to me was that of a teacher, and that's not what I became a lawyer for.
Together, we took the decision that I would move to Bombay to pursue my career and he would continue his postings. It's tough, it's really tough but it puts so many other things in perspective. For one - our long letters have become long whatsapp conversations!
We see each other maybe once in every 4 months, but those 15 days of seeing and being with him mean everything to me; to us — we have a 3 year old daughter. I feel like there are no words to speak of an army man's passion towards his country. Here we complain about bonus and leave dates, but in the army you're at the same rank, with the same pay for a decade before moving up. He's currently in aviation, but there are days when I wake up with anxiety an ask him not to fly. There are days when I miss him so much and my daughter will console me and tell me it's for our country. He's such a good father that even though he's so far away, he's involved with her school work — he often makes her recite what she learnt in class on the phone. 
That's the thing, we only celebrate our Jawaans once they've lost their lives, but we need to celebrate them everyday. My husband has lost so many of his batchmates to war or technical failures. There are days where there's no communication between us because he's in an area where there's no network and finally after days he'll call us up to tell us he's okay. It's so difficult for us, and even though this is his profession, I don't think there's been a day where he's complained — everyday he wakes up with a smile on his face because he's serving his country.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/543246659217649/?type=3,2016-09-29 08:57:54,81076,2276,10855,70002,9508,1477,17,69,3

So now he sleeps and stays there, but comes here to eat. It all works out perfectly somehow -- whenever she leaves to go out, he comes here and spends time with me and whenever she comes back home he goes there to sleep.

188056068070045_542014976007484,"""I was born in Kamathipura. My mother used to be a sex worker because she was trafficked here from Kerala, but when she met my father who fell madly in love with her -- she gave it all up. Even though they were married and she started working as domestic help - my family couldn't afford to move out of Kamathipura. 
Growing up, I faced a lot of discrimination. I had everything going against me - a dark skinned Indian girl from a red light area. At school, the other children refused to talk to me or play with me. They would call me a 'crow' or 'black cow' behind my back and treat me like an untouchable. I was always by myself and at the age of 10, one of my professors at my school took advantage of the situation and raped me. Our education system is such that we're not even taught about what a good touch or a bad touch is, so how was I to know? I was too scared to tell anyone until the age of 16 when I began therapy and realized that I had been raped.
My only coping mechanism through everything has been theatre. I'm part of a street play group where we go around explaining through theatre what a 'bad touch is' or about menstruation and sex. So many times, the cops in Bombay have shooed us away because they hear the word 'sex' -- it's so infuriating that we live in a place where we'd rather let our daughters get raped then explaining these things...just because it's considered a taboo. 
My parents moved back to Kerala in 2013, but I've been here in Bombay because Kamathipura is my home. And it's a beautiful home -- there's so much love here. The women here are amazing, beautiful humans who have treated me like their daughter. I remember, a few months ago I was crossing the road when a taxi drove over my foot and refused to even stop. To him, anything he did in Kamathipura was acceptable because everyone there is 'dirty' according to him. But these 2-3 women charged upto him and said 'how can you treat our daughter like this?...get out of your car and apologize'. So many times men will look at me and make lewd gestures, but these women will come to my defence and tell them to back off. 
Funny isn't it? I was never discriminated against in Kamathipura, but I was outside. I was never sexually abused here, but I was at a school in Bombay. That's why I'm still here. Through Kranti I went to San Francisco for a programme called 'Girl on the Run' and I learnt so much. I found people were so accepting of my color, my background and my abuse. For the first time, I could speak freely about sex without worrying about a cop shooing us away. I learnt so much that I wanted to come back here and make my home a more accepting place through my theatre.
Why is beauty so superficial? You maybe fair and I'm dark, but I still feel beautiful. Why is beauty associated with skin color? Why does where I come from matter? Why can't we see people for the good in them? Why can't we just accept?""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/542014976007484/?type=3,2016-09-26 08:28:58,50187,1594,7898,43981,4954,196,6,1030,20

They were trying to do everything to make him feel better, when my mother decided to try and coax his favorite celebrity to send him a message.  After weeks of chasing, Salman Khan sent him a short clip encouraging him to stay positive...and when he saw this clip-- he was thrilled! 
When I saw the smile on his face, I decided that I wanted to see that smile on other children who were suffering as well. As a 12 year old, I thought of what I could do. After brainstorming I decided to open a small lemonade stall during summer and combine it with a garage sale and guess what...I collected 3000 Rupees which I was thrilled to give to charity. 
I then started making bookmarks and dream catchers at home, to raise money for an old age home as well as a school called Kanya Patshala. When I visited their school they saw my colorful bag and umbrella and said that they wanted the same -- so that's what my goal was. For months, I collected money from Garage sales and the products I sold and gave a colorful bag and umbrella to each and everyone in that school. 
My next goal is to collect money for a computer for their school -- they told me that they've never used one so I promised them that I would try and make it happen. It's only a matter of time-- I'm working hard on it. To be honest, I know the amount I collect isn't a lot, but I'm doing my best to make a small difference.

As we got home, Andrew went outside to open the locked gate while I remained in the car whose door was left ajar. I heard someone making noises which I now realize was to draw my attention. 
As per the insidious intention of the attacker, I turned my face around to make sense of it all, and before I knew it a cup of fuming liquid was splashed on me. I vaguely remember him uttering a few words where he accused me of being too ""full of pride"", too ""boastful"" and my first reaction was to think of him as a mentally disturbed person. I ran out of the car screaming and shouting in shock and agony, my face doused in a viscous smelly liquid, straight into the backyard of my neighbours. I thought it was tea but the woman told me it was acid. They kept telling me how it was acid and I kept repeating to myself that I will survive this.
Soon after, people gathered around me, panicking, throwing water at all my burns and with each splash that hit my face, my body, I felt as if I was set afire. I begged them to send me to the hospital and throughout the way I grappled with hope and faith by uttering fervent prayers.
I was driven down to the hospital where the doctors began washing me with saline water, but that is all the help they could extend— they didn't have enough facilities to treat me.
Andrew, after the mishap was behaving hysterical. He was screaming loudly because of which everyone thought that he too had been attacked. So both of us were taken to another hospital. The doctor informed me that I had sustained 42 percent burn injuries. At that moment I had vision in both her eyes. I was then shifted to ICU special burn ward. There I was washed again. My skin by then had become so brittle that you could tap on it and it would sound like a hollow, decaying wooden box.
Next afternoon, Andrew escorted by a nurse, came to visit me during the lunch hours. He told me that he will always love me, even if she is scarred and disfigured. I responded to him by assuring him that I would bounce back just fine and that it's only a passing phase. Thereafter he went back home, and all of a sudden in a few hours he went missing, never to be found again. The doctor advised my family and friends to hide this news from me as I was already suffering from a lot of physical and mental trauma. 
After a month of exfoliation, I was advised to get skin drafting done. They tried their best to save my vision, but eventually complete vision in my right eye was gone.
The surgeons back home in Zimbabwe only looked out to treat my wounds but did not pay much heed to my looks. They advised me to go in for plastic surgery but there is only one plastic surgeon in the country and the entire procedure would turn out to be way beyond my means. That's when I was advised to come to India. I visited Apollo Hospital where they performed skin drafting on my face.
My son calls me everyday to ask me if I able to see and my daughter is slowly coming around to accept this face as her new mother. I am hopeful that I can go home to them and look after them — it's all about my children, and it breaks my heart to know that they are without both parents at this present moment.""

I couldn't even complete my education-- I dropped out of school after the 10th Grade to help my father with fishing but I still continued to play football. I would wake up at 4, fish, practice, eat, fish and practice again. The happiest day for me was when I could play at the National level -- I felt I was 1 step closer to my dream of being an International player. That happiness was short-lived because I realized that in order to reach that level I would have to train all day and needed equipment that my family could never afford. I didn't even want to ask, so on my own I killed my dream and began to focus on my family's fishing business. 
It was a few years later that I saw a group of boys playing football, just like I used to when I was a little boy. They came from families who weren't able to afford proper coaching but they had talent that could take them far. It reminded me of how my dream was cut short,  so I decided to start coaching them.

My mother was determined to prove them wrong, and she would relentlessly made me exercise my limbs and read to me all day hoping that I would take my first step and say my first word. Call it what you may, but that miracle happened out of the blue -- I began to babble and walk!
Still there were complications during my school days when I was a slow learner. I was often bullied because I was 'too skinny' and often found it difficult to focus and study. The boys in my class would often  call me gay, purely because of how I looked on the outside, but since the beginning I took it with a pinch of salt. I would go home, think about how I could reply in the wittiest possible way and then laugh at myself. I didn't enjoy studying but I loved to make people laugh and perform, so I joined Theatre Arts in the 9th Grade and began to love it!
My father didn't think I could make a living with Theatre, so I got into Engineering after my 12th standard -- but my heart was still in performing. I wanted to travel and get into street performances but I diverted my focus to Engineering and tried my best to do well. No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't understand it. No matter how many hours I studied, I would still fail -- I was depressed on every level. In my third year, I mustered up the courage and told my parents that I wanted to drop out. I told them that I hated engineering and that I had wasted so much of their money on doing something I didn't love-- I was miserable. I dropped out and started 'Soloplay' -- I began to write my own plays and travelling. I wanted to prove that Theatre could make a difference, so I went from village to village performing street plays which tackled issues like hygiene and health care. As we went along, we realized that we could even solve internal village issues by performing in front of Panchayats -- and on so many occasions we could convey through Theatre what they couldn't convey through words.
I'm currently on a 2700 KM journey across India...traveling, performing and just...living. Don't get me wrong -- there have been difficult days where I've survived on just Britannia cake and water for 25 days straight -- but believe me I would have it no other way!

I said yes in a hurry and didn't think too much about it. A couple of days later, when I passed by his shop he asked me if I managed to try a Puchka and when I said I hadn't -- he asked me to wait and before I knew it he had gotten me a plate full of Puchkas from a stall nearby.

It was a short four hour flight, but we really hit it off...so when we landed I asked her for her number. We began talking, and then talking a lot. It was easy to speak to her...I didn't realize when our night phone calls went on until early morning. It came to a point where I knew that I loved her, but I was then based in Qatar, she was in Bombay and I had no idea when I would even see her next.
It seemed best to leave it alone, so both of us threw ourselves into work and decided to be friends and catch up once in a while. Last year, I found myself on her Facebook profile after we hadn't spoken for a while, and decided to message her-- I was going to be in Bombay for four days and I wanted to meet her. Just the thought of seeing her made me so happy -- it had been 2 years since I even saw her, but I felt so strongly about her. Even in the four days that I was in Bombay, she had a flight to catch so we barely even had time then but I insisted on seeing her, even if it was for five minutes.
I went to her house, saw her for the first time after two years and told her in the five minutes that I was there- 'I don't want to complicate anything, I want to marry you.' She was shocked, because she thought it was so out of the blue. She left without saying much, but before getting on her flight she agreed! Our whole journey has had so much distance, but I've never felt this close to someone.
The next time I saw her, I gave her a ring which was carved with the words' L2 loves R3' -- our crew seats for the first flight we took!

At that time, a love marriage was unheard of, but even so within the first few meetings I began to love him. I used to live in Panvel, so every other morning before work he would take the bus at 7 in the morning, before work to meet me. If he couldn't make it in the morning he would come in the evening with Gajras for my hair. We would go for movies on the weekend and eat at a small dhaba near my house -- those days were the best.
1 week before my marriage, he suffered from multiple paralytic attacks and his entire left side was immobile and the doctors didn't even know how long it would take for him to recover, and if a full recovery was even possible. As soon as I heard about this, before even reaching the hospital, I went to my boss and told him that I wanted my job back. I had decided to quit because my in-laws didn't want me to work, but I knew that they all would be in a terrible situation if no one was earning. I then called up my parents and told them what had happened and to my shock, they wanted me to call off our wedding. They all thought that he would be a liability to me and if I wasn't even married, I could easily find another boy. This wasn't even a question for me -- I had fallen in love and if he had a medical condition, it was my condition to deal with as well. In his most difficult hour, I wanted to be there with him and do everything I could to make him heal -- I didn't listen to anyone who said otherwise.
We did get married, and 'till date that has been the best decision of my life. The initial few years when his left side was immobile, I would go to work and come home as soon as I could so that I could help with his exercises and read to him. We would try to make him walk sometimes even one step the entire day just so that we could see some movement.  Slowly, but steadily he began to make a recovery and within a few years he was able to walk again -- he could even go to work!

Life has actually put us through some pretty difficult experiences around the same time. Where we come from, the men think it's normal to drink alcohol every night and on many occasions, through the day. Desi alcohol is available cheap and at every other joint-- so our men would drink together and be happy with the little income they earned because it got us two square meals and a roof over our head.
It was us women who were concerned about the bigger costs -- sending our children to school, buying their books and having atleast a small tubelight at home under which they could study. We realized that everyday while we were doing our chores, we would worry and complain about this same issue day in and day out. We tried talking to our husbands about doing something but so many times we would not get a reply and when we did it would be 'we'll see what to do'. Finally, we decided that we would have to do something ourselves -- we all set out to find jobs any job that required manual labour. They both got jobs as domestic help, and I got a job as a cleaner at a nearby school. 
With time, we realized that we were happier outside the house rather than listening to our husbands slur and abuse us at home. Strangely enough, all three of our husbands passed away or left us around the same time -- two of our husbands passed away in a car accident and her husband left her for another woman. But instead of feeling sad, we felt liberated in a way -- no one likes being woken up late at night by a drunk man and more than anything our children no longer had to feel scared of beatings or having no school to go to. 
We have full time jobs now and at around 6 every evening, we meet here, enjoy some fresh air, chat about our days and wait for the chaat wala to come.

""When I was 5 years old I used to work at a tea shop, but one day when I dropped a tray full of cups I ran away, terrified. I couldn't go home to my abusive parents, so I ended up at Malad Railway station. I stayed there until I was 8, polishing shoes, eating from the bin and singing in the train. One day, Sister Serafina came upto me and said, 'come to Sneha Sadan, we will take care of you', but I was scared because previously, people had lured me into their homes and raped me. After she kept trying, I finally agreed and that changed my life -- I was there for the next 10 years under her and Father Placie, who got me a job as a driver/manager for Mr. Eustace. 
I worked there for 13 years and it was from him that I learnt to speak fluent English, and understood the importance of creating my own identity. Every year he would gift me something for Christmas, so during my 4th year, when he asked me what I wanted -- I said a trip to Barcelona. I told him that here, people would always look down upon me as a street child, but I wanted one opportunity to travel the world and discover -- and he gave it to me. My biggest love is Bombay and do you know what I felt, when I saw my heart from the sky?
I came back, inspired and with the help of Eustace I started Sneha Travels to help people from all over the world to discover my Bombay through my eyes. I made many international friends this way, one of who pushed me to write my own book -- so me, a street child who has never picked up a book to study, began writing. My neighbours corrected the grammar, a friend from Spain published and I had my life on paper -- Bombay/Mumbai : Life is Life, I am because of you.

I would work odd jobs and pay my college fees with whatever I saved up. Meanwhile, my father's addiction got worse and my parents were constantly having fights. He got more irritable with all of us, and he made it clear to me that he didn't think a girl could make a father proud-- her final and only goal should be to be married and that's what he wanted for me as well.

I tried to work on it, so did he but eventually things started getting really ugly between us.

I moved into my own house and began to understand that it was okay to not do what society wanted of me. I began to read, do things that I've always wanted to like- getting back into dancing and working with even more passion at my job.

188056068070045_529117510630564,"""Most of my childhood was spent outdoors - either playing cricket, football, tennis or skating. I wasn't very good at studies, as soon as the school bell rang, I would be out on the field until dinner time! My tryst with full time cricket began in a funny way — I won the gold medal in only one sport when I was around 10 years old and that was in skating! My father sat me down that day and said, 'I understand you can't study but if you love sports so much at least take one that can get you somewhere…focus on cricket.' That's how it all started. 
Even while growing up there were struggles — I didn't get selected at the under 14 trials in Haryana, but at every step of the way I pushed harder towards the one goal that I wanted to dedicate my life towards…playing for India. I still remember, my first real 'job' was playing for Air India's corporate team and my stipend for the whole month was 500 Rupees given by Punjab Communications.
The real turning point was the Under 19 World Cup where I performed better than ever before. I remember at that point, I would watch Tendulkar and Ganguly on my television set and know on every fibre of my being that someday I would be out there playing with them— I felt it, I knew it; I believed it. In 2000 I got the opportunity to play my first International game with these big guns. I can't describe that experience — in my head, I was still the little boy from Chandigarh running around on the field, muddy, breaking windows with my shots but when I looked around I saw my heroes — Tendulkar, Ganguly, Kumble on the field with me. 
As I eased into playing with them, they turned into my family. Having always been a prankster, the Indian dressing room was no different for me. On one April Fool's day, Bhajji and I decided to prank Ganguly. We went down to the business centre and reprinted the front page of the Times of India, with bogus stories of Ganguly saying nasty things about the entire Indian Team. Before the match, we gave him the newspaper and said we were very disappointed. He saw the newspaper and lost his cool. He began to say, 'if I've ever said any of this I'll resign as the captain'. We let this go on until Dravid decided to tell him it was April's fools day which made him even more angry — he chased the two of us around the field with a bat in his hand!
Jokes apart, the journey has been tremendous. Whether it was hitting 6 sixes, or winning the 2011 World Cup, these are special moments which very few people in the world have the privilege of experiencing and that's what I've always felt while playing for my country — privileged. Of course, there have been downs as well — one cannot always live upto the expectations where a nation of 1.2 billion people wants you to win every single game. 
More than that, nothing could have been worse than having to give up something you love —and I had to get out of the game for many months because of my battle with cancer. At first I was in denial about it — playing for India was more important than my health and for a few months I chose to ignore the blood I spat out or my decline in stamina. It's only once I accepted cancer that I could beat it. When life knocks down you have a choice — to get up. So I thought to myself -'get up and do it again'. I came back within 3 months of my treatment, only because I wasn't done with cricket — I don't think I'll ever be done with it.
The way I look at it, I went through cancer so that through my foundation YouWeCan I could do more for those who need it. I believe that I had to go through it to have a larger purpose. God has been kind enough to give me everything and the only way forward is to give back. I'm constantly looking for ways to push this cause and through YWCFashion, I'm looking to enter a different avenue and make the fight against cancer even stronger. Today, I sponsor the entire education of 25 kids who's parents don't have the funds. When I met them and they told me about their ambitions, I knew that this is what I want to continue doing— give back and help them make a 'come back', just like I did.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/529117510630564/?type=3,2016-08-26 09:24:59,17610,618,2072,15787,1629,183,7,4,0

When he was detected with tongue cancer, we went back to them thinking that they'll help, because that's what one expects of family--but they shut their doors to us. 
We then went to my family, who helped us as much as they could for his treatment in Kanpur, but pretty soon they were low on funds as well. It is then that we realised that we were all alone, but God provides an angel when you most need one -- and our friend since many years gave us the money to come here to Bombay to Tata Memorial.
Ever since, we've been staying here in a building provided for patient's families, away from our children who we haven't seen in two months.

The summer I turned 13 my uncle in Nagpur told me that he would teach me how to drive a scooty and as a teenager I was more than thrilled with his offer! When the time came to teach me, he took me a little away from our bungalow and sexually assaulted me. I didn't know how to react — I had never been touched that way before and had no idea what a bad touch felt like. He threatened me and told me not to tell anyone and as is I was terrified to tell my parents, or anyone because I felt like the blame would somehow come back on me. I decided to bury this memory and move on with my life, but that never happened.
That incident left a scar on me — I began to spend more and more time alone. As fate would have it, when I was in the 10th grade another incident occurred where a group of 10 drunk men attacked my friends and me, late at night near my house. My shirt was completely torn and I had scratch marks all over my body and that's when I felt like I had had enough. I was emotionally drained as these two incidents kept haunting me every single day. I was terrified that people would find out and I wouldn't be able to show face.
I told no one about it and the burden was too much to bare— I started getting suicidal. I thought these things that had happened were shameful and I had caused my family shame. I went through a very dark time and It took a lot of months of acceptance and sharing with people I love that I realised that it wasn't my fault. We're so often shielded from what a 'bad touch' is or aren't told about sex or rape until we have to find out the hard way. I wish I could go back in time and voice myself, get some justice…but at least I'm free of blaming myself. I know today that my dignity doesn't get compromised because others chose to violate it.

He wrote her a love letter and the next time she went to his store, he gave it to her and she agreed to go out with him. Turns out, they used to even live opposite each other, and if they had plans to meet, my dad would whistle below her building. They would communicate with each other through their windows and when dad used to go to work, my mom would run to the PCO during his lunch break to call him. They had an intercaste marriage, fighting all odds and in every sense they complimented each other. When dad lost his job at one point, mom supported us and dad took care of me… they were always balancing each other out.
Dad had been a smoker for 30 years, he tried to quit many times but whenever he did it made his health worse. When he passed away, I was numb…I couldn't even cry because it was so hard to believe that he wasn't with us anymore, but I had to be strong for my mom. It was like a part of her had passed with him and to live without him initially was terribly hard for her. She would send him text messages for days after he was gone, she would talk about him continually and I don't think there's a day in the past 5 years that she didn't speak about him. Eventually, she became stronger and the two of us would spend all our free time together. She worked hard and gave me everything…I don't think I could have asked for a better mother. Through this time, I was going through a bad phase at school. My only friends were a group of boys, because they didn't gossip, and the other girls at school called me a 'slut' without even knowing me. I have never hurled those profanities at anyone because I know best that you never know what others are going through. I began to channelize my energy towards photography, something that helped me emote and express myself. 
But most of my focus was on my mom and we began travelling a lot, just the two of us and she even gifted me this scooty on my 17th birthday! 
On one occasion, we were on the highway to Indore, travelling together as always when we met with a car accident. I was in the back seat of the car fast asleep and before I knew what was happening I woke up with a start and saw blood all over me…all around me. It wasn't mine. My mother had sustained a severe head injury, and even though we were all out on the road asking for help— not one car stopped for us. After a lot of time when one car stopped, half the people got off and took my mother to the hospital. She had multiple fractures and a head injury but she didn't make it. I lost her on Mahashivratri, six months ago…and all of a sudden, at 18 I found myself alone. I can't describe the pain of losing her - my best friend, my strongest support. 
I moved in with nani and realised that there were responsibilities waiting for me — bringing groceries, managing finances, taking care of nani and understanding the value of money. It's difficult, but I can't lose hope. Mom bought me a DSLR on my 16th birthday and this bike on my 17th and I believe it was a subtle message that I should travel and photograph to live my dream...our dream. 
I wish my story conveys two strong messages -- first- don't push plans with your parents to 'tomorrow' -- sometime that tomorrow doesn't come; everyone's time here is limited and second-- don't bring down people you know nothing about-- everyone is going through something, so before calling someone names or tearing their character apart, think about this and show some compassion.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/524819084393740/?type=3,2016-08-16 08:17:01,60836,2347,8877,50562,6418,226,9,3617,4

I volunteered with them that entire summer and knew ever since that it was my calling, but I decided that I would pursue it a bit later. 
As I went on to complete my MSc. in finance, opportunities started pouring in. I got a job as Derivatives Strategist and then became a Business News Anchor for CNBC TV18. I then took a sabbatical to write my thesis for a Ph.D in Economics and as I was finishing my doctorate I had an important choice to make. At 26, the job offers were flowing in, but somewhere in my heart I was strongly drawn back to the development sector. The logical part of me said, 'take the job' 'get back into econometric modelling' but my heart was telling me to jump headlong into doing what I love. I asked myself what it meant to have a dream and what was the point of waiting until the right time? There was no better time than 'now' and that's how I took a leap of faith and began to head an education project at an NGO which focussed on children from forgotten parts of India as well as conflict zones like Kashmir.

So much has been written, but it's only when you get there that you can actually understand what Kashmir is all about and what the people have been through.""(1/3)",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/523206757888306/?type=3,2016-08-12 08:46:45,7318,123,170,6754,477,86,0,1,0

Back then, there were no cell phones so the only way we could stay in touch was to meet. We would decide where to meet, show up at that time and then spend all day together. There were no formalities, we would enter each other's houses as and when we pleased and wolf down whatever was made to eat! In fact, when we joined swimming classes, our mother's were most stressed about our food after…there were times when each of us would eat 20 eggs in one shot!
When we played chor - police, the allotted territory was all of Bombay! We would be running around the entire city all day 'till at night one of the teams just gave up. There were days we would go to Babu Cycle Wala and rent cycles for 50 paise, cycle all the way to the domestic airport where we would watch the 'dance of the conveyor belt' and gulp down free water from the big cooler…it was all a thrill. Now days, we're too cautious, but back then at the age of 9 and 10 we would hike to the nearby jungle land where there was no electricity or food and we would cook ourselves our own meal…all this is unheard of today.
As we grew up, we were perpetually broke, so there was this one day when we went to our favourite restaurant and ordered 1 plate of paneer with 30 plates of gravy — the server just looked at us too shocked to even speak! Thanks to being broke we would also ask for car lifts very often because we couldn't afford a taxi and around this junction only, Sunil Shetty gave us a lift in his ambassador…anything was possible!
When we were about 20 years old we would love driving, but back then only one of us had access to a car, so we would all squish in and drive around. On one occasion, we drove all the way to Panvel and because it was too late to return, we stayed at a cheap hotel. There were no cellphones, and we were anyways low on money so there was no way to inform our parents…they were going crazy back here in Bombay. But the next day, we did a coin flip — if it was heads we would take the left to lonavala or tails we would return home…ofcourse we drove all the way to Lonavala and when we got back, we got the blasting of our lives and weren't allowed to even go near that car for a long, long time!
As years went by, one by one we started to get married and the best part of our friendship is that it's so contagious that our wives and children sometimes get along better than we do! We still take trips together and enter each other's houses as and when we please…just like the good ol' days. Just the other day we were all here at the park and we saw a group of old uncles in white kurtas and walking sticks, chatting away to God's glory and laughing (with barely any teeth) together. We immediately thought that this is going to be us someday…from childhood to old age, together.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/521121601430155/?type=3,2016-08-07 08:41:57,13562,660,749,11424,1878,242,16,2,0

When I turned 26, I got engaged to the love of my life and we were all out celebrating at a club one night when it happened. I walked up the stairs from the basement to attend to a call, and on the staircase someone brushed passed me, I lost balance and fell. I remember trying to get up to get my phone and call my friends but I just couldn't move…there was no sensation. Within minutes she found me and as she placed my head on her lap she realised that I was profusely bleeding. It took one hour for the ambulance to get to us…and even after I reached the hospital at around 4 in the morning there weren't a lot of doctors. All through, I knew she as hospital phobic…she would get anxiety even at the mention of a doctor but here she was, yelling at people to hurry up, call the doctors and get things moving.
I went into surgery at 11 in the morning and thought that I would recover…it didn't even occur to me that I may not have sensation because my spinal injury was so bad…on the 2nd day I just broke down and started crying. My fiancé flew down and we all thought that with physiotherapy I would get better…but it wouldn't work. I refused to get on a wheelchair for the first few months so every day she would come home, try to make me feel better and put me before her on every occasion. When I finally knew that there was no solution after 2 years, I told my fiancé that I loved him too much and that he should move on…it was a difficult decision but I knew in my heart it was the right one and through that entire time, she was with me as strong as a rock.""

""When your best friend goes through something like this, your life changes completely as well. For months after, when the rest of our group was making plans I would first think of her — basic things like going out for coffee or going out to bar…how would she do it? It was like a part of me was immobile and I was ok with it as long as I could make her feel better.  When she finally decided to get on a wheelchair, I said, enough is enough we have to change this mood — the two of us began to travel all over the world— in fact, she's the one who even organised my bachelorette party for me! We were in Miami and we wore these goofy halloween costumes, we've partied nights together, bag packed across Europe and had the most bizarre adventures. While here in Bombay, the two of us started a salon together which is completely wheelchair friendly. We work together, we travel together and laugh way too much! She's unbelievably strong…I remember when I was getting a divorce 4 years ago, she was at my doorstep everyday…she never let me slip and I remember thinking about how her problems were so much bigger than mine but she never stopped smiling. She's courageous enough to share her story and we're even starting motivational seminars together…she's so determined that she still plays badminton and is hopeful of representing India at the Para Olympics! 
We have so many memories together but my happiest one? When I met her on my first day at FYJC — a thin, scrawny girl riding into college on a huge bike and me thinking to myself 'this girl is so weird and quirky — we're definitely going to be friends.'""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/520988518110130/?type=3,2016-08-07 00:36:48,36235,2121,3044,30513,5167,504,9,42,0

At the end, I shared a message for my parents in English and translated it into Hindi...hoping that I could inspire more people from my village to send their daughters to school. While many families frown upon girls going to school, my parents were so proud of me -- I want to become a teacher quickly now, so that I can teach other girls like me and help them reach their dreams.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/519442704931378/?type=3,2016-08-03 08:04:19,12184,88,281,11059,1044,80,0,1,0
188056068070045_519052498303732,"""Since I was a 3 month old baby, I would have to get my blood pumped every two weeks… that is the life of a thalassaemia major patient. It wasn't my parent's fault, but the negligence on the part of a doctor to inform my parents that because they were both thalassemia minors, there was a high possibility that their child would be a thalassemia major. Even though he profusely apologized after I was born, what was done was done. Growing up, I read every article I could find and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't live more than 16 years…everyday was filled with fear, wondering if it was my last. 
Before I knew it, I turned 17 and realised that with the progress of medication my life could be extended as far as 30 years…it was like life was telling me, 'you still have time, what are you doing with your life?'. Death eventually has to come to everyone so why was I scared? I just started living each day as if it were my last — I threw myself into adventure sports, climbed multiple peaks and even began working my summers at a travel company, taking children on treks. 
But it was last year in November, when I decided what I wanted to be known for once I was no more. I started an NGO called The Wishing Factory where we make the wishes of thalassaemia major and leukaemia patients come true with the help of corporates or just regular people with big hearts. I started off in Vadodara and now here I am in Bombay, trying to make more wishes come true as I attempt to get my degree in biotechnology.
So far, we have completed 101 wishes of these patients who have a few days left to live — be it simple things like a young 5 year old who had never sat in a car, getting her first car ride or bigger things like a helicopter ride around Bombay! It's my dream to grow to every state in India and give these patients who have very little time, some memories and more importantly some much needed happiness. 
My bigger goal however is to research and study so that in the time I have left, I can at least make some progress on finding a cure. The way I look at it, at the age of 20 I can either sulk around about not having enough time, or make my time here, no matter how short it is…worth living. So that's what I'm doing; I'm making sure that each day counts for something and giving back as much as I possibly can.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/519052498303732/?type=3,2016-08-02 08:08:47,22409,512,2658,19345,2433,570,3,56,2
188056068070045_518620988346883,"""Everyone usually tries to get internships between the 10th and 11th grade to add to their résumé and I was no different. I started interning at an NGO called Swades and for the first few weeks I sat at my desk and assigned self help groups — it was boring and monotonous. 
One weekend my colleague was going to a village called Khamgaon where our volunteers often visited and asked me to join him…I immediately agreed! When I went there, I was blown away. The students I met were intelligent, educated and motivated but their confidence was at an all time low because they didn't know English— they felt small and inferior. Something in me shifted and I decided that I wanted to make a change -- these were people from my country who were so ashamed, all because they didn't know English...I felt responsible to do something for them; for a better India... no matter how small the step was.
 I reached Bombay and asked the CEO of Swades to let me go, stay in their village and attempt to teach them English. She said she'd never done something like that before…but she wanted to give me a shot. I reached Khamgaon without any other volunteer from Swades and stayed with a local family who welcomed me with open arms. It's like what you see in the movies… — houses made of cow dung, a walk to draw water from the well, green fields and exceptionally tasty chapattis. 
Swades had a sewing class for women at the centre, so I made it a point to go there the day I arrived and tell these women that I was here to teach them and their children English. I then went door to door, introduced myself in Marathi and tried to break the ice. The first few days I started off with one student, then two but one week later the entire sewing class of women showed up to learn English! Slowly but steadily I had 3 different batches running through the day — of little children, women and college students. Everyday, I would think of new ways to challenge them, to teach them and to help them string sentences together word by word. A few weeks later, when I was at the market I overheard two of my sewing women students talking about which vegetables to buy…in English! I was delighted!
Everyday after I would return home and help Naitri Tai make dinner, my little students would come to me with questions… 'Didi, how can I use this noun? or 'What does this word mean?' — they were thirsty for knowledge and I was thrilled that I could be the one to give it to them. 
I didn't realise when 2 months passed, but on my last day the entire village came together to give me a 'bidai'. They planted two trees in my name, but the gift I got afterwards was one I'll never forget all my life. My little students came in front of the audience and gave me a farewell speech…in close to accurate English! The last line they said was, 'Thank you Didi, for changing our life' and 'till today, I get goosebumps every time I think about it.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/518620988346883/?type=3,2016-08-01 07:56:56,31896,702,1673,27810,3306,772,4,4,0

We would treck, explore, meet locals, stay in tents and cook our own food – there was something about the mountains that called out to me since then. I was so passionate that over the next few years I completed the basic and advanced mountaineering course and in 2008 I became the youngest person in the world to climb the Satopanth peak in the Himalayas. It was around this time that climbing Everest became my dream— but it wasn't easy.
To start off with, it's a really expensive process but my family did everything they could for me. My father took a loan from the bank and our house was put on mortgage without telling me a word— I was told that big corporates finally came ahead to sponsor my expedition. At 19, not only was I the youngest person on my team, but I was also the only woman — and that pushed me harder. 
We began the climb and the journey to Everest brought difficult circumstances to us. Early on, we had to face an avalanche and a snow storm, but the worst part of it was losing a team member. I was scared, but I couldn't allow the fear to take over me…so the only thing to do was to move forward. Over the next few days 2 more of our team members had to be rescued half way, but I was determined to get to the top and take in as much as I could on the way.
I distinctly remember a moment when I was above the clouds and the sun began to rise on one end and the shadow of the mountain gave darkness to another. I was part of that shadow but I was still above the sun. It was a moment when everything stood still and I was a part of day and night all at once. 
When we reached the top I struggled to feel something, there were people crying and others screaming but I just felt silence, I felt Shuniya, I felt complete. The only thing that came to my mind at that point was my family, and how I wanted to make it back down to tell them about the top; about how much I love them.
I did reach down safely and in the same year I attempted to become the first woman to climb the 7 highest peaks— but 750m away from the final peak in Alaska, there was a political intrusion and I couldn't finish my climb or get the record — I was so upset, I cried for hours. It was only later that I realised how foolish we are to give so much importance to success or failure, but no importance to the journey of it all. 
I got back to life and started to tell the stories of my climb through my dance. So that's my story — I've climbed Mount Everest and I understand that just because I have, doesn't mean I'll be successful or always make it to the top - it doesn't mean everything I do will be as thrilling as the climb— it just means that I'm trying and I will put all my heart into trying no matter the success or failure. That's the one thing climbing Everest taught me — that there is infinite power in what the heart wants and if you have the courage to trust it, life will present magnificent things to you…not necessarily 'at the top' but even on the way there.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/517358511806464/?type=3,2016-07-28 23:49:36,13556,432,1155,11897,1285,373,1,0,0

The next few years were great -I was madly in love with him, but as life would have it, I'm Muslim, he's Hindu and his parents weren't okay with us getting married. In 1979, they started showing him girls for arranged marriage. One day, when we were supposed to meet, he didn't turn up and it was only after I spoke to him on the phone the next day, that I realised that it was because he had agreed to get engaged to someone else — he said that he was tired of fighting with his entire family. I felt awful…I wanted to kill him, but I maintained my dignity and walked away with grace. That was the year we both got married to different people…and I thought that was the last of it.
Years passed by — I had two children and an entirely different life. Even though I had so many mutual friends with him, I never saw him — we both wanted to respect each other's new lives and happiness.  Ofcouse we thought of each other, there are times when you can't help but think because there was so much love at one point, but none of us ever did anything about it — all I knew this entire time was that I'd never truly stopped loving him.""
""As fate would have it, both our marriages didn't work out and after 7 years we met at a common friends party.

We saw each other and asked a very stupid question — 'what are you doing here?' but that's how it all began again. We picked up exactly where we left off — none of were bothered about the past, who's fault it was, what the reason for our divorces were — we were only concerned with the future…our future. I wasn't going to let her go the second time around, so one day when we had gone out for a walk at Turf Club, at the age of 37 I asked her to marry me…and she said yes!

When he started getting violent, I decided that I didn't want to be one of those women who tolerate abuse.
I told him that this job was taking a toll on his health and he should return to our village for a few months while I took care of our finances.

I didn't give up -- I stopped giving him money to buy alcohol and even though he was violent towards us all earlier on, he realized that the only option was to leave.

A few years later, my mother was detected with cancer and at that point in time my life was in turmoil. We managed to get the funds for her treatment but what we didn't have was knowledge of multiple schemes which could have helped us.
During her treatment at the KEM hospital, there were many families like mine which were from weaker financial backgrounds but in the time of need we would help each other out by sharing medicines and sometimes a wholesome meal. When I would skip class to look after my mother, the doctors or other families there would tell me to go and study and look after her — that's where I realised that compassion for others is the only way forward. 
When my friends and I would travel up and down from college by train, I started to play the guitar for them because it made me feel happier. I've never learnt professionally, but the sound of my own music made me feel free. This one man enjoyed my songs so much that he paid me money to encourage my talent…and that's when the idea first struck me. I could play the guitar on the local and raise money for cancer patients and their families. The very next day, I decided to take my music to my mother and when I played for her she had the biggest smile on her face. In fact, I played for the other families as well and slowly I felt that they all seemed happier with more positivity — since then I would play for them everyday.
In 2014, my mother relapsed and passed away. Those first few months were terrible…she was my everything, and with my brother working abroad I felt more alone than I ever had before. I would go to work at a Pharma company, but I was unhappy until a few months later in 2015 I decided that I wanted to have a purpose and make a difference. 
I picked up my guitar again and everyday to and from work I would sing in the train, collect money and give it to an NGO which looks after cancer patients with limited needs. Every other day I'm at ward number 42 in KEM hospital where the doctors are so helpful and kind. If a family urgently requires funds I would make extra trips on trains to raise it for them. A few months ago, I gave up my job and started focusing on my music and live shows…Apart from the little bit I need to survive, everything else goes to these patients. 
So that's my story - I make music, spend a lot of my time in hospital wards and live all by myself in the city…but alone as I am, never before have I felt closer to my mother— this is all for her.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/514298805445768/?type=3,2016-07-21 08:16:20,39862,1024,4303,34432,4445,750,8,227,0

I had almost forgotten what family was by then and had my eyes set on a job in Bangalore — one that I've always wanted.  After finishing my masters from NID Ahmedabad, I landed that job and I felt unstoppable. A few months into it, my father was diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease and I learnt that I was the only one who could potentially save his life with a transplant. 
I was at a complete crossroad — I was told that there was a 10% chance of not making it out alive and my father only had a 20% survival chance given his condition. I was given some time to make this decision, during which time I met a lot of women who advised me against it — they raised questions like - 'how will you give birth' or 'what about marriage?'  what I realized then is that we build so many fears in our own minds that sometimes we begin to settle in a self made cage. There was only one other man going through the same thing as me — he was a donor to his father and both of us encouraged each other to get through what was to come. I was scared, but I couldn't quit on my father…no matter what his chances were I at least had to try. 
The surgery was a success and both of us were in good condition within three months but I still wasn't at peace because of the setback at work. I threw myself into long hours, travelled to Europe and even though my health spiralled at times, I pushed myself harder.  Within a few weeks, my donor friend who I'd been through so much with suddenly passed away — I was devastated. 
After having been through so many different experiences I just decided to stop. I slowed down, quit my job and finally decided to focus on helping myself heal. I decided to take one day at a time and walk myself out of self-doubt, weakness and fear. I got so caught up in trying to chase my dreams that I almost forgot to live and to love my family.

We weren't taken care of, hardly received any education and just left to fend for ourselves during though times. As soon as I was old enough to get married my parents chose a man that they found 'appropriate'. I thought marriage was my only way out of the village and my only hope to go far away from the people who had made my life miserable. I later found out that my husband was an alcoholic too. I was shouted at, beaten and made to feel extremely inferior and insignificant every single day.

A few years after the birth of my second child my husband passed away due to alcohol poisoning. Suddenly, amidst all the existing chaos I had to support a family. I didn't receive any help from my parents and didn't know anything about Bombay so starting over and taking responsibility seemed very scary. I was aware that I had no distinguishable skill because I had never received a proper education. I felt miserable -  I had never felt so weak and helpless. But I couldn't let this break me or the dreams I had seen for my children. I wanted them to be in meetings instead of washing clothes. I wanted them to be awake late at night finishing projects, not worry about the source of their next meal.

I have been cleaning houses and cooking meals for years now. Happiness was a luxury that I could not afford but I can slowly see a light at the end of this tunnel.

I have seen Bombay go from a jungle to a concrete one and I really do miss the old times.

I have no complains from my life but I do fear that people today are lost between independence and ignorance.

Everyone thinks of themselves as supreme, everyone wants to rule the city in their own way but what kind of kings would they be if they don't have 2 words of honest love and compassion to give to the people around them?

I was one of the toppers of my class, had big dreams for myself and I'd been dating the man I loved.  I realised later  that his parents wanted him to marry a Marwari girl while I was Punjabi. They also wanted me to give up my education, but that's something my parents didn't allow — so even though I completed my masters their condition for our marriage was that I would never work — I was so madly in love that I agreed to everything. 
It started on the first night of my wedding when I didn't bleed and he was convinced I wasn't a virgin — he tortured me the whole night accusing me of sleeping with someone else. After we returned from our honeymoon he beat me up because I bought a kohl pencil for my sister —this happened in front of his parents who agreed with him. I had to wash clothes, cook, clean but never work. They allowed me to go to my father in law's clinic but only to dust his desk— I was given strict instructions to never attend to any patient. 
After a few years I got pregnant and he sobbed because it was a girl — he accused me of not giving him a boy. He began to drink, woke up at noon everyday and went to work whenever he wanted, because his father handled everything. 
I never told my parent's any of this but I broke when I was pregnant for the 2nd time. I'd just returned from England and was trying to talk to him when he told me to get lost. I took my daughter with me to the hall to sleep when he came out drunk, accused me of brainwashing our daughter against him, sat on my stomach and beat me until my entire face was bleeding. I called my dad at 4 in the morning and his parents came too, but instead of stopping him, they said I must have done something to 'provoke' him. My parents said they would call the cops and that's when he said, 'I won't beat you again but I will fuck your mind.'
That's exactly what he did — after his father passed away he would drink from 8:30 pm until 7 am and gamble instead of paying our daughter's fees. At night, he would throw cold water on me and say 'be thankful it's water and not piss', he would touch me wherever he felt like and call me all sorts of names in front of family and friends. My daughters were terrified, but 3 of us would sleep together and let him keep banging at the door. My older daughter is an athlete so we would wake up at 5 in the morning to go run at Juhu beach, while he was still drinking. Sometimes he would follow us. He would go upto my daughter in front of all her friends and say, 'where the fuck is your mother…who is she fucking now?' My daughter would try to calm him down and say that I was just walking with the other mothers. 
The breaking point came when his verbal abuse passed onto my daughters. He started calling them sluts and whores and my older daughter had a nervous breakdown in school.  I decided to leave him and when he came back home after being in rehab for the 4th time we decided to not let him in. Even after all this, I helped him get back on his feet, start practicing and even lent him my own money…but then he got me removed from the hospital where I was filling in for him while he had been drinking. Until today, he hasn't paid for anything for my daughters... even though he has 3 clinics.
At first I didn't know what to do but after 20 years I decided to open my own clinic —I didn't want any form of dependence. I work round the clock - pay for the clinic and house expenses. That man has even taken a loan against my name and he refuses to give me a divorce until I leave the house that my father and him bought together.

188056068070045_507395746136074,"""I was working a monotonous job around 40 years ago. I was working at a firm in New Bombay where my job was to unload the cargos which came in. Although I didn't like my job, I was always on time and never missed a day. I'd been working for a few years when one day I fell really ill and called my boss and told him I couldn't make it-- this was the first time since I joined the job that I wasn't going to work. On the same day, around 3:30 pm I received a call that the man who filled in for my job that day passed away because the hook of the machine broke and the cargo boxes fell on him.
I felt numb. I was so upset that he lost his life but what terrified me more was that it could have been me. I don't know what hit me, but I realized that I had been taking life for granted for far too long. What started off as a temporary job to make ends meet, grew to become a routine which I hated. 
I feel like that was the day I was born again-- I quit my job and started my own company. I've had ups and downs with that too but atleast I'm doing something that I love...that makes me believe I have a purpose. Every single day since the past 40 years, I wake up and thank God for this life and that one practice has changed everything. Because I'm so grateful, I know that nothing can pull me down-- highs and lows are a part of the process but I only get one life, a finite amount of time here and there's no way I'm going to crib about it. Life is beautiful and my only purpose is to celebrate it every day.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/507395746136074/?type=3,2016-07-03 09:38:21,15546,230,984,14364,981,198,1,2,0
188056068070045_506562049552777,"""I was born deaf and mute. We were living a good life until my father passed away and my mother had to raise my siblings and me by herself. My sisters were sent to Bombay to an NGO, but because I was the youngest and couldn't communicate I stayed behind with my mother. She worked at a dance bar, got into the sex trade and every night trusted our neighbour to look after me. 
What I didn't tell anyone for years is that our neighbour is the man who sexually abused me for many years. 
I didn't have a voice, but never before had I felt so voiceless. I was terrified of men and people in general.  I continued to keep quiet until the NGO which my sister's were a part of insisted that I join them. I still remember my first day at Kranti, I hid behind my mother's sari and wondered how I would communicate with any of them— only my mother understood me. I had never been to school before, but I started attending the Bombay Institute for the Deaf and Mute and I began to understand the world around me more. The other girls at Kranti began to learn sign language to communicate with me better and I understood what it's like to have friends who care and understand. Little by little, I broke the walls around me to allow people in.
Today, when my mother visits me I take her around the neighbourhood, travel with her in local trains and even bargain with vendors the best I can! It was only after I came to this city that I realised being sexually abused was not my mistake…and I had no reason to be silent.  My fear of men left me in the most unexpected manner. One of the girls from my NGO was taking down the trash at night, when a drunken man hit her. When we heard her screaming, all of us ran down to her but I was so angry that I chased after that man with a stick. I began to scream at him— not with words but just my voice which I'd kept within me for far too long. 
But that was another day, and I've had beautiful days since — I draw, I swim, I dance. Many people ask me how I can dance without music, but I just tell them that it's all in me - the song, the music and the spirit to keep taking the next step.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/506562049552777/?type=3,2016-07-01 08:21:19,26810,440,1443,23514,2769,457,7,60,3

She passed away that night and that incident kept haunting me, so I went inside the hospital and asked them to contact me if there were any such children in the future. 
2 such children were sent to me for different reasons. In 2009, I took a space on rent in Navi Mumbai for my wife, my two children and the two HIV positive children. At first it was difficult to make ends meet -- we could afford one mattress on which my 4 children slept and my wife and I would make do without. Eventually, people started donating -- beds, grains and money. My family of 4 slowly expanded to 24 as more and more children with HIV were sent to me. 
My wife has been a rock solid support and we've never differentiated between our children -- we scold all of them, love all of them and give them the same gifts. My wife cooks for all 24 of our children, looks after their medication and takes them for their medical check ups. We've tried to give all of them a good education and make sure that they have a life worth living.

Slowly, I began to walk again. It was painful at first but I was determined to 'able' myself again. I started going to college first by car and then by train — all in a span of months. 
The prosthetic wasn't the difficult part, dealing with people was.  Often, I would be sitting on the train and the person opposite me would keep staring or nudge their neighbour and ask them to look at my leg — like it was on display. 
What's worse is the bureaucracy — when I tried to get a driver's licence was entirely different for me because I was disabled — I thought it would be easy but they made it extremely strenuous. I had to get different medical certificates from all over the place, I had to give a different test and could only drive if the car was registered in my name. My family had to sell the car we owned just so that I could buy the same one in my name  and modify it— all for a licence.

188056068070045_499015420307440,"""I was raised in a very close-knit conservative family. When opting for what I should study in my undergrad, my father suggested B-comm and I agreed without giving it much thought. After graduating however, I realised that I felt really passionately about design and straight out of college I decided to start my own label. Within a few short years, I was running a successful company and had clients all over the world placing orders for my silk products. 
During this period, I began to take a path down spirituality and one particular ashram where I began to learn and grow. It was here that I became aware that silk is made by boiling silkworms — and it didn't sit right with me to make money off another living being's pain. I gave up my company overnight and focused on finding my purpose in life. I was married at the age of 25 and had two beautiful daughters. 
Decades later, the Ashram which I was connected to was planning to expand. I loved design and still felt really passionately about it, so I knew that I wanted to be the one to design this plan…but I had to be worthy of something so special. At the age of 48, I found my calling and enrolled myself in Design School as an undergrad student. 
On my first day there, the principal asked me if I had any financial difficulty or had any qualification in design…and both answers were a 'no'. He told me that I wouldn't last more than 3 months….and that fuelled me to prove him wrong. Funnily enough, my daughter was in the same college and we overlapped one year but that experience was the best of my life — my daughter and I would be completing our assignments until early morning and my husband would make us both coffee! Even though I was much older, I made a lot of friends…they would come to my house, I would make them some treats and we would all study together. 
I graduated with a distinction and that very principal handed me my degree — I felt truly blessed. By tremendous grace I was
given my Ashram project after I formally established my company. Today, I have 150 employees and a purpose that makes me jump out of bed every morning. Everyday, I'm trying to give back the money that I've earned myself— just recently I adopted a child who suffers from cancer and that bond is something special as well. So Believe in yourself before you expect people to believe in you. Know that an honest passion will take you places and that life is about balance but also about celebration. Faith will keep you grounded and the right priorities will give you flight. Know that there is a time for everything but nothing is defined by the time you have lost in your life — it's never too late to start over.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/499015420307440/?type=3,2016-06-11 08:13:53,16028,488,1410,14388,1375,260,4,1,0

When I was 6 years old, my neighbour who was like a brother to me said that he'll take me to Bombay and educate me. So desperate was my thirst to learn, that without telling my parents I went off with him. It was the biggest mistake of my life.
He sold me to a Nepali family for 50,000 Rupees and ran away.  Theirs was a proper family with 2 children who went to school everyday, while I was made to clean the house and if it wasn't properly done - I was beaten. At 8, I was forced to go to a dance bar and wear inappropriate clothes. I would scream to go back to my family, but it was pointless. They would beat me with belts and stub me with cigarette buds to drown my voice out but when I would keep screaming and they couldn't house me anymore — they sold me to Kamathipura. 
Here again, I was beaten and forced to attend to over 10 clients a day — at the age of 10. I was broken — I lost my childhood and wondered if I would ever see light again. But amidst the darkest of humanity, I found someone with a heart. When he was told that he was my client…he was taken aback. He realised how small I was, so the next day he went to the police station and brought them to check on me. On realising that there was a police raid, some girls hid in a trap below the floor, others in a ceiling flap and I was pushed into a cupboard. The police kept searching for me and even though I was scared of being beaten, I decided to raise my voice. I started banging from the inside of the cupboard, they opened it, rescued me and took me to Devnath Home in Chembur. I was given days of counselling and taught to read and write, but there are some scars which even decades can't heal.
After 7 years, I was shifted to Purnata, a hostel where my new life began. I took hair cutting courses and parlour treatment courses. With this, I got a job at a parlour where I've worked everyday and slowly collected money.
Today, I've bought my own house with the money I saved up and a small loan from Purnata. I have a honest job, good colleagues and many friends. Up until now, I haven't told my colleagues my story out of fear that I will be outcast…but I've had enough. I want to show my face and have pride in my journey. The highlight of it all? Every month, I go back to Kamathipura the very place that has haunted me for years to counsel those who are stuck and encourage them to leave with me — so many have.  I've even tried teaching those girls whatever skills I have, just so that they're motivated. A time will come, when I go to that place and have no one left to save…but until then I won't stop trying.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/497449810464001/?type=3,2016-06-07 07:41:17,23601,544,1968,20546,2142,625,4,272,12
188056068070045_496512877224361,"I lived in Ahmedabad with my parents and 4 sisters. I used to work in a beauty parlour there to earn some money for my family. At the age of 24 i was married to a man who claimed to be from the same community as myself. He promised a simple but secure future for us in Mumbai. On reaching here I realised it was all a lie.

We were living in a single room with no basic amenities, he was not a builder but used to iron clothes for a living. He worked till midnight and drank till he fell asleep. I was not allowed to speak to anyone, get out of my house or work. I wasn't even allowed to eat dinner unless he was hungry which was generally at 3am post work. I was also never allowed to cook anything accept rice and dal, if meals were left over then I was not allowed to eat anything else for breakfast or lunch the next day. Between all this and the continuous physical abuse my life began to crumble into scars, blood and tears. At one point the beating got too much and i went back to my parents home but due to their own limitations there was only this much help i could take from them. 

I decided to come back to Mumbai and soon i was expecting my first child,i thought it would make things better but i got beaten up and kicked a lot more thereafter. He would accuse me of sleeping with other men and refused to admit the child was his. In my ninth month he kicked me in the stomach and threw me out of my house which is when my mother came down from Ahmedabad and took me there with her so i could deliver my baby.

I gave birth to a beautiful boy who then became my pillar of strength. On the fourth day post delivery my husband came to the hospital, beat me up, took my son and ran out of there suddenly claiming that because its a male child it's his. Once again I was compelled to go back and live a life there for my son. 

That is when I kept telling myself, If he slaps you twice, you need to slap him back once but by making something real of your life.

This time around when I got back I decided to work. I began going door to door finding clients and provided services like waxing, facials and so on. Soon my clients began to grow in number and I began to make a living for my son. During this time my husband fell seriously ill and his kidneys began to fail. I supported him through his surgery using the money I got by selling jewellery, donations and personal savings but despite this there was no change in the way he treated me but I didn't care. My heart was beating for my son and it was only his future i needed to look forward to.

I earned enough over time to make a house for myself but during the heavy rains a large tree collapsed on my house but I didn't back down. I worked harder, slept lesser, ran around for a million permissions and re built my house around the same one room i used to live in before. Now I have 6 rooms where I work, live and still play host to my husbands younger brothers who continue to ill treat me & refuse to pay for anything in the house despite having a good salary.But the land i live on is still in my husbands name and the cost of a new space in mumbai is far from something i can afford and so i need to continue living with them in the house. 

i made enough money to send my son to college in Gujarat and today i am providing for a family of 4 which includes my son, my husbands two brothers and my dog named Tuffy.

Today I stand fearless, having seen struggle beyond my imagination. I believe that determination and faith in my own strength can take me places, I believe in living a honest and driven life, I believe in celebrating life no matter what and I do this by learning traditional dance forms in my free time to keep me happy. I recently performed on stage with my group for the first time and despite knowing no one in the audience I danced my heart out. 

Yesterday was my husbands 10th year death anniversary and my son and I both payed a tribute to him by doing a small prayer and giving the local cow Prasad as per our traditions. But when I'm asked repeatedly by my clients to re marry i only have one response…I am complete in me.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/496512877224361/?type=3,2016-06-05 06:29:17,13958,445,684,12610,946,312,2,73,15
188056068070045_496241280584854,"I grew up in Australia, until my family moved back to India when I was 8. Following that, my life has been pretty humorous. I was teased for having an Australian accent, but picked up the Indian accent pretty quickly. While I was at BIS, I remember being ostracised from the group of boys because I was very open about liking girls, what I liked about them…and the others were still going through the 'we don't like girls phase'. 
I then moved to The American School, where I was teased for having an Indian accent…I decided then 'fuck accents' and say the words the way I liked how they sounded. I guess I've always been acting... It's always been around. I never thought much about 'career,' but I've never loved anything more than movies. Even though I didn't major in acting at college, I took interesting classes which challenged me. I didn't do a lot of work, but I realised that I wanted to make the most of everything…I was directing my own plays, writing and making a complete fool of myself.
I remember this one time, as a dare I stormed into this Karate class and said 'I challenge you to a fight to death'. The professor then came upto me, lifted me up by the collar and said… 'I will make sure you are incapable of ever taking my class' — I was fucking terrified and humiliated. It was still the orientation period at college, and I thought I was in serious trouble. Apart from that, my college life involved late night discussions, drugs and nudity…but my PR team has given me a strict talking to about revealing those stories.
I got a play straight out of college and worked at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta for a year after which I returned to India and went to an Ashram in Bihar for 5 months. This was the point where I had less interest in acting and more interest in discovering things about myself…so I took off. When I returned, I wouldn't say I struggled, but I did odd jobs here in Bombay, went for auditions, got rejected a bunch of times but the thing that kept me going was that I never doubted getting roles. I knew it was a matter of time so I took whatever was happening in the meanwhile as a road to eventually getting there. 
My life has been a series of passionate decisions - from acting one day to dropping everything and going to an ashram, from being a hard core meat eater, to becoming purely vegetarian, from working round the clock to dropping everything to just walk around… I like to do things that I didn't expect myself to do. Life for me has been about limitations and pushing myself to beat them. It's been about learning different things…and knowing that I can learn anything with time and patience and knowing that I will succeed. Advice? I don't really have any advice…I would say— just try to live your life. I mean I'm barely living my life…who will I give advice to?""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/496241280584854/?type=3,2016-06-04 10:32:57,6220,223,164,5912,263,39,6,0,0

Obviously, when the time came to apply to college I applied to an art college here in Bombay and realized that I would have to give an exam to get in. In a one hour time limit I had to paint an object that was placed in front of me and even though I could manage it...that wasn't my definition of art and I didn't get in. How would I? They only accept 10 students out of the thousands who apply. I was disheartened, but I didn't give up and attended a private art institution. A few weeks later, my teachers there said that I don't have a future in painting and that I should try something else out. I left this institution and applied to the same college which rejected me earlier, but I failed again. I felt terrible and in order to feel better I applied for a BA course and started attending college...but my heart was only in the art that I wanted to create. 
Two significant things happened in 2015 which changed my life. I lost both my grandparents in a span of 6 months. I spent a lot of time with them before and having seen me being so passionate about art and still failing, my grandmother said to me - 'don't worry about these minor hurdles...you're going to do great things.' Around the same time, my BA semester results came out and I had failed 4 subjects...I decided to drop out. So there I was at 19, rejected from art college twice and failed my BA already. The only thing that stayed in my mind, was what my grandmother said and the passion I felt. I started painting more than ever, fuelling my failure to push me harder. 
In December 2015, I started posting my art work on an Instagram handle I created. Day after day, I started receiving messages and comments about my work and before I knew it I got my first major feature in Huffington Post!  Someone even wanted me to make a painting for them -- so I even earned my first money through the art that I felt so passionately about. Today, my work has been featured on multiple platforms and I have over 57,000 people following my art...all because I failed my first semester, while I was trying to be somebody I wasn't. I'm applying again to the same art college and I still don't know if i'll make it or not.

Why do you believe in God?
Because of my mother. When I was a kid, she talked about God like he was her closest friend. She was convinced he deeply loved her. Any concern she would talk to God, trusting him to work it out or care for her in some way. 
She would tell me, quite candidly, that she was praying and that God would act upon her concerns. For years, I regularly saw what seemed to be answers to her prayers. I watched her life through a myriad of circumstances, and her faith in God was unwavering.
Ever since then I've believed in God but not just the one we worship in temples, but those around us. For me, my mother is no less than a God -- she's taught me about faith, kindness and being a good human.

It all originates from what we as children grow up believing or accepting as the truth. If as a child you talk back, throw tantrums or are withdrawn…there are reasons for all those things, but we just don't understand them.
While most schools focus on the Intelligence Quotient of young adults, very few focus on the Emotional Intelligence…something that helps children reflect, understand and correct their actions. I founded 'Global Village Children' to help schools include Emotional Development into the curriculum of children. 
What we want the world to understand is that, disgruntled children go on to become disgruntled adults. If we teach children that we can't control the actions of others and that we're responsible for the actions of only one 'being' in the entire world - ourselves…we will empower an entire generation. 
The only way to World Peace is to raise a generation thats at peace with themselves, and the road to that is to place as much importance on our emotional understanding as we do on Math, History or Physics.

I've always been a housewife who loves feeding my children everything they wish to eat and it pained me to know that these children weren't getting to experience the excitement of eating their favorite dish. 
Since then, every weekend I feed about 350 children from orphanages and the Blind School, whatever they wish to eat. I wake up at 4 am every Saturday and cook for them, as I would for my own children and this is the highlight of my life…I live for it. Just last weekend I made 50 kgs worth of mango ras for them and my God, you should have seen their faces! They were thrilled… and I can't put into words how that made me feeI-- I was just so happy.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/491331354409180/?type=3,2016-05-24 08:20:49,23484,443,1587,20519,2687,274,3,1,0

We were all sent to school, but in the 7th standard my family decided that I should drop out — and I didn't fight it because I knew that money wasn't coming in easy. My brothers continued to go to school and I took classes in sewing and embroidery, until the age of 14 when I got married to my husband who was only 16 back then. In our community, this wasn't unheard off. Even though we were both children, the responsibility on us was immense — my father-in-law was no more and my husband's brother passed away in a train accident, leaving behind his wife and two children who were to be looked after as well.
At the age of 15, I began to go door to door in big buildings, asking if their trash needed to be collected. I started collecting trash this way and it led to me becoming a rag picker. I was always well received by people who would call me a 'sweet girl' or give me sweets to eat, all because I never complained about anything. Some of these people gave me bigger jobs like cleaning their home and I took on them gladly because I knew that my family desperately needed the money. 
I became a mother after a few years and I wondered how I would tell my children that this is how I earn my money. I decided I would wait until the right age — but all of my apprehensions disappeared when the time came to send them to school. I realised, that if it weren't for the 10,000 Rupees I was earning every month…they wouldn't have an education. I had tears in my eyes as I thanked God for everything — the foul smell of garbage, the hard days of going door to door and the different homes I cleaned. 
Both my sons accept my work and there is nothing more I could ask for. I was terrified that they would be embarrassed of me, but they have been so supportive. My younger son recently wrote an essay on me for his class. It was called, 'My Mother Keeps India Clean'— I didn't understand a lot of it but it was enough just to know that he wrote about me…I'm a happy mother.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/490893801119602/?type=3,2016-05-23 07:30:50,33603,744,3491,30523,2697,329,10,44,0

We were living in a village in Andhra back then and being the oldest son, I had to give up my education in the 5th standard and start working. I used to work two jobs - one as a farmer and another in a clothing shop, but despite that money was tight -- so my uncles got my  younger brothers and to Bombay, in the search of more money.
As soon as I came here, I landed a job of washing cars. Today my day starts something like this - I wake up at 4:30 and wash about 30 cars in one day to earn 13,000 Rupees a month. A few months ago, I took up an additional job at a Gas Agency where I work as an LPG Delivery boy -- I earn 400 Rupees a day to deliver 35 gas cylinders. 
Last year my uncles abandoned us, but we managed to get our own kholi in Dharavi -- it's small, but it's a home none the less. I cook a hot meal for my brothers at about 4 in the morning, and then they help me wash cars...I'm happy I at least have some family here. We miss our mother terribly -- she's still in our village, but at least she's happier now that we are fending for ourselves and putting food on the table. 
At 22, I feel like I'm doing as much as I can. Sometimes my body gives up -- that's how exhausted I get but even after all that labour the money isn't enough. Every month however, I save a little and put it away for my education. I was a bright student, and the child in me still wants to sit in a classroom and wear a uniform. I have my schedule in place -- I'll continue to wash cars before and after school to keep my income alive and  I'll sleep 2 hours less to complete my homework. I know I haven't saved enough, but in the 3rd standard, I once learned that 'slow and steady wins the race' -- I believe that, that will be true in my case as well.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/489657294576586/?type=3,2016-05-20 00:00:13,16802,370,1105,15351,1055,320,2,74,0

My parents forced me into getting married to a man who lives in a nearby village. I accepted their decision, moved away and tried my best to become a home maker. A few months into our marriage I was pregnant and at that age I was scared, but little did I know that I would have a lot more to fear. My husband, brought home another young woman, casually and began living with her without even giving me an explaination. I can't describe those feelings into words. There's no worse pain than emotional pain and I knew that I couldn't live like that.
I left him and came back here to Bombay only to find that there was no comfort back home either. People were doubting my character, asking me humiliating questions about my child and treating me like an outcast. At 20, this was a huge burden for me to bear, but it was the fact that I had a child in my stomach that gave me strength. I ignored what people were saying and silently began working to support myself. My brother allowed me to stay with him as I worked at multiple houses to support myself and save for my child's needs. I kept myself so busy that there was no time to listen to anything that was being said and it got even better when my son was born -- my entire struggle melted away. With great pride I sent him to school...I still remember his first day. There were times when it was tough to juggle my jobs, cook for him, pick him up for school, but we managed and managed really well -- today he works at a machine factory and has a beautiful family of his own in a small town near Bombay. I could have lived with him, but I love my life here...
Yes, I am a divorced woman, but my life has had more meaning than that. Let me tell you that the initial challenges have made me a strong independent woman. Through this process, the one thing I've learnt is to keep growing and pushing forward. Since the past 10 years, I've joined a library and read two books a week...which has helped me grow and understand affairs of the world. I also stitch quilts and bags as a side business while continuing to work as domestic help at a few houses. 
At 60, I'm not only a single mother, but a single grandmother and I'm not ashamed to be called a 'divorcee'. In India we only have modern technology, but no modern thinking. Being divorced isn't bad, sometimes there's no other way out.

They don't see me as a young man with hopes and dreams of making a living and having a family. I am just like everyone else but was dealt a terrible hand of fate. When I started working at the construction company as a labour manager in 2004, I thought my life was set. 
8 months into my job, I was overseeing the labour on the site when I felt dizzy and fell into an open pothole. The pothole had no water, nothing to soften the blow and the 14 foot fall has led to lifelong consequences. I was unconscious for 10 whole minutes and when I woke up, I was given some water and ointment and sent back to work. A few years later, I began to have nosebleeds. I was referred to a local hospital and they did a series of tests. For 10 months, they poked and prodded and I went on for surgery. After my first surgery, the doctor called me into his office. 
He had tears in his eyes as he said that they can not operate any further because I have intensive nerve damage in my brain as a result of my fall 7 years ago and I could lose my life. I can also lose my life without the surgeries. As I asked the doctor to help me the same way he would help his son, the doctor wiped away a tear, took my hands into his and told me all he can do is pray. I left, disappointed. 
Months later, I started noticing my skin rotting away. My eye would begin to blur at random moments and one day I woke up to find that I could no longer open it. I have lost my eyesight, my skull is eroding and I can no longer afford to visit a doctor, having spent all my savings on medical bills already. I have no family to help me financially or emotionally and I lost my job with my eyesight. The same employer under whose guidance this happened fired me and asked me to fend for myself. For four years, I have depended on the occasional odd jobs to earn a living. I now know that my one true pillar of strength is God. I don't know how I'm still alive, but I am. Every attempt I've made to gather funds has failed — I even wrote to our government asking for help but all my letters and requests went unanswered. 
At times, I have thought I should just die. But I want to live. I have hands and legs, I want to make the most of this life that has been given to me and I know that God is holding my hand every step of the way. He has brought me here for a reason and just as my luck would have it, people are now interested in at least understanding my story. I know that this is a sign for me to fight for survival and with all this support, I feel as though my life holds a sea of possibilities…I just need some help getting there.""

Even though I worked at the factory all day, I was determined to educate myself -- so after a 8 hour work shift, I would attend night school and do my homework until the early hours of the morning. As time went by and we had more expenses, I took on more odd jobs like handling a laundry, but I still went to night school and completed my SSC. The one thing that I carried with me through this time, was a smile. No matter how tired I got, I would remain positive about better things to come. 
After my SSC, I didn't have a job, but I had a passion for music. I would go on auditions hoping that someone liked my voice, but I never really got selected. After one audition, a man in the audience came upto me and said that my voice touched him -- he said he wanted to help me in whichever way he could. He recommended me for an airline job and after multiple interviews -- I was selected. I started off as a cleaner, and rose through the ranks to become a mechanic...and that career lasted 38 years!

Education wasn't really possible because we had to make ends meet...so I started working from a really young age. My life had only struggle and poverty until I met my wife. She had the most selfless heart. Everything got better with her around and we had 3 beautiful children.
A few years ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. I didn't know what to do or where to go. I took loans, borrowed money from friends and family and tried to cure her....but nothing seemed to work. She kept telling me not to spend this money and keep it for our children, but I was desperate to save her life. 5 years ago, she passed away and everyday I feel her absence. I had to fill her shoes and become both a mother and a father for my children-- from cooking, to cleaning to earning. Eventually, it became harder for me to balance both, so with a heavy heart I had to send two of my children to live with my sister. I send them money every month and hope that they're studying hard with my sister. 
So that's my life today -- I'm a security guard who's earning 7000 Rupees a month, and trying to be both a mother and a father for his children. I really miss my wife and value how much she did around the house -- I now understand how difficult it is to run a home. All that said, I'm still happy everyday because I have three beautiful children and I want to see them get an education and succeed. That's my biggest dream.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/484154401793542/?type=3,2016-05-04 23:59:34,12493,148,533,11045,591,9,1,847,0

188056068070045_480160332192949,"In the summer of May 2004 I was a 16 year old girl with big dreams and hope for my future. I didn't even know then that the demon that would destroy my life would be my next door neighbour, a man nine years older than me. It began with casual catcalling every now and then, which I tried my best to ignore. That summer when the catcalling took a new turn in the form him of him hurling obscenities at me, I finally mustered up the courage to tell my parents. On finding out, they were enraged and decided to talk to the boy's parents. The boys parents were understanding and made it a point to give their son a piece of their mind. Things went back to normal from that day, he stayed out of my way and I thought he had learnt his lesson. Little did I realize that he had been harbouring such immense hate for me, that 4 years later in  2008, he caught m off guard and attacked me with acid. He didn't even wait for justice to prevail... right after attacking me, he ingested poison and killed himself. I never even got the closure of justice and he got the escape of a quick death. Its very easy to press the quit button on life and get rid of all of your problems, he was a coward when he attacked me with acid and he died a coward. The hard part is surviving, which is what I am doing. 
 I felt like my life had ended and it did for 6 years, but little did I know that this experience would lead me to understand what true love is. I met an amazing man who was willing to look past all my external appearances and made me feel something I hadn't felt in a long time…he made me feel beautiful. We got married a few years ago and I felt like I had been reborn. I even managed to get a job at the hospital and that has given me the chance to move forward in life and be a part of society. I've been happily married for almost two years now and I""m excited to grow my family.

He didn't give me any money for anything, so I began to do odd jobs in my village to make sure that my daughter and I could at least survive.
One evening she fell really sick and I begged him to give me some money to treat her, but he refused. I was so ashamed to ask my parents for money, but I had no other choice.

I began to look if something like this existed in my city- in Bombay and found nothing. I graduated from college, came back home and stood at the crossroad of what to do next — I had a degree in Industrial Economics, but my heart was someplace else and I wanted to explore a little more. I took some time off, read widely and even tried to get a thing or two going but the question of why nothing like HONY had been implemented in Bombay, kept gnawing away at the back of my mind. 
On one particularly lazy Sunday I decided to go for it…no plan, no strategy. At the time, I had no idea how to operate a professional camera, or how to approach people on the street to get them to talk to me…but I just knew that I wanted to desperately give it a shot. 9 out of the 10 people I approached said, 'no' to even talk to me, and most just looked at me like I was a crazy stalker. But the feeling I got when the 10th one said 'yes' was irreplaceable. I couldn't believe that someone who I didn't know was ready to share their life with me…I held onto the feeling and pursued it harder. With a mere 10 stories of people I'd spoken to on the streets, I started a simple Facebook page called 'Humans of Bombay', with the hope that people would love knowing a stranger as much as I did.
There were a lot of questions - 'where is this going?', 'what's the end goal?' or 'how is it viable?' and my only answer at that point was it made me feel something I wanted to hold onto.
2 years and hundreds of portraits later…the process has been more than worth it, and it's finally time to take the next big step.

I grew up in a Muslim area, but even though we were Catholic we never felt like we didn't belong. In fact most of my 60's were spent playing basketball in shorts in our neighbourhood and nobody seemed to mind. Back then we had an Indian Identity where everyone wanted to 'be the change'. 
I was a social activist myself — I spent a major part of the 80's fighting for women rights in slums - for their ration cards, education, electricity and everything that classified as basic rights. I worked in rural villages in Maharashtra for 4 years to fight against the dowry system. After 4 years of relentlessly fighting and convincing, as many as 11 villages didn't have the dowry system anymore. These women who I fought for even forced me to stand for elections and even though I knew I had no chance, I stood for them. Of course I lost — I had absolutely no money and no backing but it was an experience none the less.
Since 13 years, I've been teaching culture studies to students and in a way I feel like I'm doing my part trying to educate another generation about our culture. My husband continues to be a social worker, in fact he's just returned from a trip to Satara where they're implementing a water project…but the reason I started teaching is to try and instil the 'Indian Identity' in this generation. 
The problem is we only become 'Indian' when we're playing a cricket tournament or we're playing Pakistan in the World Cup. That's not what an Indian Identity is about -- it's about going out there, getting your hands dirty, making a change YOURSELF and not playing a blame game with the system.

My parents along with the National Association for the Blind took the decision of sending me to regular school instead of a special school to give me as normal a life as possible...but it wasn't easy. I went through hundreds of rejections before the Principal of my school in Thane stood with me and said he will make sure I succeed.
Growing up in any school is hard enough, but for me it included a lot of children laughing at me, never choosing me to play with them or to be in their study group. Very early on I realized I would have to prove myself every step of the way and work harder. I began enrolling myself in every competition - elocution, story telling, essay writing...you name it! I began studying harder, all thanks to the help of my parents who would relentlessly read to me everyday and readers who read to me when they couldn't. Slowly, I began to get accepted and that victory felt amazing. Like every other child at some point realizes what their passion is -- I knew mine was accounts and mathematics and that's when I took the decision to become a Chartered Accountant. People said it was impossible, but I found a way of even making math accessible to my condition.  I would bring the book as close as a centimetre away from my face in order to understand the numbers...and then guide my writers on how to answer the questions from there.
The syllabus for the final CA exam was around 10,000 pages and let me tell you I've studied the entire syllabus more than thrice and cleared it! I thought the struggle would finally end, but little did I know that getting a job would be my next hurdle -- no company was ready to hire me. They've always looked at me as a liability instead of an asset...but I will keep pushing until someone understands that vision is in the mind. As of now, I'm a teacher to MCOM students and I'm loving that role as well.
What people don't understand is that I'm not disabled -- I'm differently abled. I will be able to do all that you do...just in my own way. I travel the Bombay locals on my own, I can text you, call you, cross the road and even set papers for my students all by myself. I have a lot of dreams -- I want to become a motivational speaker and hone my photography skills. Thankfully, I'm 25, I have a lot of time to make all of them come true!

We never borrowed any money from anyone and both of us were equally involved in building our home together -- we cooked, cleaned and created our life from scratch. 
Even though our parents are okay now, I'll never forget those days because they made me realize just how special having a 'partner' really is. It's someone you can build a life with... who's there with you every step of the journey and he's been more than perfect. A year after we got married at the temple, he bought a Lehenga for me and said that he wanted me to dress up and have a proper ceremony.  I was happy marrying him in any attire, but for me, he had another ceremony where both our families were present and I was dressed as a proper 'bride' that time.

It was a joint family, so continuing my education was not an option, but somewhere within me I always felt like I had missed out...that I wanted to study further. I gave birth to three beautiful children, and my thirst for knowledge was so much, that I never allowed them to take tuitions until the 9th standard -- I would teach them myself,  but after some time the subjects were too advance for me to grasp. Often I would tell my children, how I wish I had atleast graduated and made something of myself and they would always tell me to still give it a go. At first I would laugh it off, but once my daughter got married and my other two children were busy with college, I began to consider it seriously. 
In 2013, after 30 years, at the age of 51 I decided to fill out the form for my FYBcom with the encouragement of my family. I still remember my first day in college -- I felt so overwhelmed because all my classmates were young students! I had sleepless nights wondering if I would be able to cope, but my children helped me every step of the way. It was such a strange feeling -- all my life I'd taught them, but here I was at 51 learning mathematics from my son and how to write essays from my daughter. Even my mother-in-law would wish me best of luck everyday before I went to college.
Funnily enough, I started making a lot of friends. These youngsters are so accepting of everything that they immediately made me a part of their group. On one occasion, my mother-in-law was admitted to the hospital because of which I couldn't go to class for a few days, but my friends...these young children would meet me after class and teach me at the college courtyard. I've learned so much from them as well -- I'm an active participant of our class's Whatsapp group which I had never even used before!
The time I was most nervous was during my first year exam. After I came out of my last exam, I saw all three of my children waiting outside for me, just like I used to wait out for them after their exams. When the results came and I had cleared, my husband was the happiest...he was so overwhelmed that he started crying and immediately took me out to buy a sari...it was the best day of my life.

The first few months were tough, with no work and no money - I would survive on almost no food for days on end. A few weeks later, I got a job as a house maid and I couldn't believe that I could actually earn my own money. At first I was worried about how I would work and how the people would be -- but I had nothing to worry about. Coming to Bombay and working for this family has been God's way of helping me.
The strength I have today comes from the lady who employed me - she's my mother, my friend, my everything. She loaned me money for a new house in my village and helped me pay for my children's education. They've treated me like their own family -- they introduce me to all their friends who come home and treat me with respect. A few years ago, I was extremely upset and asked for leave for a few weeks...when she asked me why I kept trying to avoid the question, but she kept pushing me. Finally I told her that my son needed some form of a heart surgery and I wanted to go and stay with him during the time. What she told me next, still makes me cry...she said, 'your son is like mine, let's take him to our family doctor and get his opinion.' Not only that, but they bore the entire expenditure and allowed me to leave work for those few weeks without any pressure. 
Unfortunately, my son passed away a few months ago and since then I've been feeling very alone. Even though I have my daughter and grandchildren, I feel really lonely. But then I think of my other family -- the one that's been with me through a major part of my life and feel like it's not so bad.

She was working as a journalist too, so we started off by just casually acknowledging each other, or waving from across the office. Eventually we started talking and became friends. There's a time when you know there's more than just friendship, but you haven't admitted it yet…well we were in that phase when we went out on our first unofficial date. We just walked around our office area, ate a heavy meal at Gamdevi and then I dropped her home…I remember waving 'bye' to her until she could still see me. 
I knew she was the woman of my dreams and I just had to marry her. I proposed to her with an absolutely blank mind…I wasn't thinking at all. I was dropping her to Matunga station one evening after work and I told her at the platform, 'I love you, I want to marry you and make you happy every day for the rest of your life'. She was too shy to say anything so she left in a hurry but the next day she came to work in this beautiful white dress with frills all over and kept smiling…and I just knew that it was a 'yes!' 
Her parent's were dead against our marriage at that point because we were from different communities, so we saw no other option but to run away and get married. Today's wedding's are all about how much money is spent or how grand it is…but all we really wanted was to get married and spend our lives together. We had a simple but beautiful ceremony at a small temple where we made our vows. 28 years later those vows are still as strong and mean just as much. 
Over the years we kept trying to convince her family to accept our marriage and finally, they had to give in. We have a son, whose also married now-- life has been amazing.

A few weeks after his death, I resumed working at the school in Sion where I had worked for many years…but everyday, I only thought of ways to do something for cancer patients.  About 2 months later I met a doctor from Pune who told me that there was a hospital in Pune, where little orphaned children were suffering from various stages in cancer, but were not given the right treatment because of the lack of resources. I adopted all 28 of these children and took each one of them as my own. I moved them to our plot in Wadala, where they are now cared for and looked after by a doctor 24 hours a day.
When I first met them, many of them were not expected to live beyond a few days…but now 7 years later most of them are still alive, healthy and happy. I've had a lot of volunteers who teach my children and people with large hearts who have donated heavily to our school. Because they're prone to infections, I myself am not allowed to visit them except on Sunday… but that is the day I cook for them and feed them with my own hands. 
I continue to work at my school in Sion, but my colleagues and principal have been extremely supportive. In fact, I am allowed to leave 2 periods early to attend to the needs of my other children…there are beautiful people in this world who have always come forward to help. That is the only way I can make sure I attend the chemo sessions of each and every one of these children…I never want them to feel alone in the hospital. 
But by far the best feeling in the world is to cook for my children…they appreciate every little thing. Just the other day one of my girls wanted to eat chakris…so when I made some and fed it to them on Sunday, that little girl said to me, 'Geetuma your cooking is world best!'

However, I decided to become a GIS engineer, and got a high paying at an MNC right after.  Around 2004, when my father was the sub inspector, he had a kidney failure and had to give up his service. He was really upset not because of the kidney failure but because he wanted someone in our family to be a part of the service. This was the point in my career where I was going to be promoted and sent to the Canada office but when I told my mother that she said that 'If Indians start leaving India, who will help change the country?'
Somewhere I felt that I had a certain responsibility towards my country, so in 2006 at the age of 26 I gave up my job and became a police constable. At first it was a little bit difficult...moving from a comfortable corporate salary to a small amount. My wife was even skeptical to marry me because she was worried about my erratic timings and lack on involvement in the family. But eventually none of these things mattered because of the pride I felt in serving my people and my city.  
Little incidents started holding a lot more value than any amount of money. I remember I was posted at Andheri where there was a heavy traffic jam under the Andheri fly over...when a man came running to be and said 'my sister's water just broke, she needs to get to the hospital.' The jam could last for hours so my colleague and I helped her cross the highway to the other side, took them to the hospital in our van and she gave birth to a healthy baby boy!

As a teacher, I felt the need to contribute somehow to rural areas, so a few professors and I began teaching students in government schools over the weekend but the root of the problem was still that there was no proper primary education.
2 professors and I wanted to start a school of our own, but had no funds to do it. I had been a part of the corporate world, so I thought - 'how difficult can it be?' The answer is very. I wrote to 250 big corporates, attended meeting after meeting, but got rejected every single time. None of these big companies wanted to invest in a whole school but just events like sports day which would help them promote their brand. I began to think, where else could I collect money from? That's when the idea struck me that Bombay trains were the one place where I could talk to people and collect money from the people FOR the people. 
In September 2010, on the train from Goregaon I made my first announcement in the first class compartment and told people why I wanted their money. I then walked through the train with my donation box and on that first ride, managed to collect 700 Rupees!
Since then, every single day I spend 7 - 8 hours on the local asking for money from people and in 5 years have collected over 1 crore Rupees from trains and other angels who've heard of me and want to donate. It hasn't always been easy - people have said I'm a cheat and a liar, called me a beggar and I've even been arrested but none of those things matter when the end result today speaks for itself. We have built 5 English Medium schools in rural India which educate 480 students upto the 4th standard. 
One such area is Yavatmal where farmer suicides were rising. After the school was constructed a media person asked a mother there what the school means to her. What she said next, changed my perception of life itself. She said, 'Our husbands want to commit suicide, we don't have money for even one meal a day, but what this school gives us is hope. This man is like God to me' and the only thing I thought was that every person who has donated to this cause is a God in his own way and that thought gives me goosebumps.

I studied at Poddar for about 2 years and then shifted to boarding school when I was 11 years…and i hated it. I was miserable. I was a closed off kid who wasn't really social or good at studies and I just wanted to leave. The only thing I really loved was music, but there was this one audition I took in boarding school where I was rejected and I decided never to try again. I moved back to Bombay to a small school which had only 6 students in my class.
There was this one time when there was an event at school and there was some money in a drawer that I stole. I then went across the road to an alcohol store and bought my first beer from that money. I started stealing from home as well and thats where it all started. It got worse when I went to college…I didn't know what to do with the new found freedom. There was a pub opposite Nationals where my friends and I would just go and drink all day. In order to support the alcohol I started stealing bigger amounts from my mom. I ended up getting caught a couple of times, went to a shrink, stopped for a while but relapsed soon enough…I would even drink alone. My stealing became worse too. My father had remarried so I stole my step mother's jewellery and sold it off for almost peanuts and again got caught. They removed me from that college and tried to take control of my life…but It was a little late. I had begun to smoke weed and hash with my college seniors. Over time that progressed to chemicals — anti epileptic tablets. People said half a tablet was enough but I would take 2, then 5 then 10 until I was taking 30 pills a day. I shifted to a having bottles of cough syrup that had opium in it….and I was hooked. 
During this time, my mother refused to give me any extra money so I decided to drop out of college when I was 18 and got a job to start earning. I even had a girlfriend who tried really hard to get me out but it didn't work. I was part of a band, but because of my drugs I left that too. My mother also remarried and moved to Dubai so eventually I had to stay as a PG in Bombay. I got thrown out of 3 different PG's for stealing and drug abuse. I've gotten into shit with the cops for stealing as well. My mother would send me money from Dubai but because I was so addicted, I would spend all of it too soon and then just starve for days together…it was terrible. 
At 21, I had reached a point where I was spiralling towards never looking back when my mother flew down from Dubai and reasoned with me to check into a rehabilitation center. I decided to enrol myself in one such centre a little outside Bombay and that's what changed my life.  I was there for 15 months where I was given freedom to write and pursue what I wanted. I started song writing and singing and even worked there for a few years after. 
It was difficult coming back to Bombay and started fresh. I was terrified and for the first year I just focused all my energy on work. I got a diploma in Sound Engineering, worked with Channel V, Web 18 and still focused on my music. A few years later… after I'd sent out my work to almost everyone  I had a breakthrough. I got to sing 2 songs for a movie and I haven't looked back since. 
What's it like being sober? I've been sober for 13 and a half years and I can say it's the reason I'm happy today. It's the reason I'm grateful today. For my family who has loved me through my best and my worst and in fact loved me harder when I was so difficult to love. For the hundreds of second chances I got.
Today I'm living my dream of being a musician and I'm engaged to the woman of my dreams who accepts my past and loves me. My message? Using drugs is not cool…being dependent can ruin your life.

From drawing cartoons to playing basketball and running on every sports day...I was always an active participant. After my 10th board exams, I had a pain in my knees and at first we thought it was just a sprain because of the sports I played, but it started to swell and when we got the test results back-- we realized it was bone cancer. 
At first there were a lot of questions in my mind -- 'I'm only 15, I've always been healthy and active...why me?' I couldn't understand it, but instead of crying over it I decided to shift my focus and sketch. Through the year I had 3 surgeries and 9 chemo sessions but through all the pipes that were going through my body...I used to draw cartoons. Cartoons which made me smile and distracted me from what was going on. I did lose all of my hair and I had to learn how to walk all over again, because there are no bones in my right leg...its all metal! Physiotherapy was painful...I used to scream with pain but I knew that I had to walk again and it would get better. I had control over my mind at all times...there was no room for negativity. 
To be honest, the only time I felt really sad was when I realized I would never be able to run again. I've always been a runner...whether marathons or school races, it's been my biggest passion. Still, I got over that fact and moved on by accepting and making the most of my situation. I remember, there was another girl my age who also had bone cancer but had to get both her legs amputated because her family couldn't afford metal implants and that's when I realized I took what I had for granted -- great parents, financial stability and so many dreams.
Cancer took away one part of my life, but there's so much more it gave me. Every bad thing is redirecting you towards a good thing and that's a fact of life...believe me, I've lived it! I decided to take up animation as a career because of my sketching and I have a great job today. I've made so many friends through this process and it's given me the courage to talk about my journey and tell other's that cancer is not the end of the world.

As it turns out, I eventually realised he had no passion or drive to be someone in life and I was the opposite. I juggled my post graduation with a part time job to make ends meet for both of us.
It wasn't long after I started working that I realised that my boss had a dirty eye for me. He would stare, keep me back at work at odd hours, tease me and harass me. I eventually decided to quit my job to get rid of him, but he caught me in a contract and I had to give a months notice before I could actually leave. The night before my life actually changed forever, I had a dream about my ailing grandmother. She was crying and kept trying to warn me that something bad was going to happen. The next day all I could feel was this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew something bad was going to happen but I could have never imagined this. This is not bad, this is worse than death. I walked out of office at 7pm and there he was, my doom in the shape of a man. The end of my life had his face covered with a handkerchief.  
Like a coward, he doused me in acid in the fraction of a second. I could hear myself screaming but the only thing I felt was my soul leaving my body.  I often wonder how I survived but then I realised that I had no hand in that. Surviving was the easy part and so is existing but living… living is the hard part. I won't lie -- I even tried ending my life, but failed in the attempt.
7 years in, I still seek justice and closure because he's still at large. I am partially sighted, disfigured beyond recognition and mentally scarred. The sun set in my life a while ago but at least now I have hope that it may rise again one day.  After all, how long can the rain last? One day I'll dance under my rainbow. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow…but someday. Why? Because giving up would mean he wins and I can't let that happen — not for me, not for the hundreds of other girls out there who have been victims of acid attacks.""

I started my medication and within 6 months I had lost 95% of my hair. I began growing a lot of facial hair and had a swollen face, and as a teenager you can imagine what kind of reaction that provoked. I was teased, bullied, made fun of and while the other girls at school were flirting with boys…I was busy hiding. I went from a social, happy child to being completely withdrawn. I tried to shift my focus to studies, but the medication even affected my memory but I somehow managed.
During college, I was completely shut off. I would wear a scarf around my head, look down while walking and avoid any eye contact or communication. People obviously speculated about me, but I had my walls up so high — I didn't want anyone to hear about my condition and cut off from me… so I thought it was better to cut myself off from the world. My years in college went by like this - speaking to no one and keeping to myself. 
After college I took an entire year off and sat at home because I was scared of filling out job applications which always asked about medical conditions. I would sit at home all day, speak to no one, watch movie after movie, show after show and go to sleep. I was depressed and kept wondering 'why?'… 'why me?' All this while my mother would keep telling me try on a wig and just get a move on and finally I decided that I simply had to leave and get out. 
I bought a wig and went to work but again with a lot of fears and insecurities — I tried to keep to myself as much as possible and would even dress like a man so that no one would notice me. One evening, I was going to work by train when while trying to get down, a woman pulled at my wig and it came off. For those 2 minutes, I was entirely numb…it was like the identity I had hidden for more than a decade was pulled off me. Tears started rolling down my face, as everyone on the platform watched. I picked up my wig, got into a rickshaw and cried for the first time in public. My parents were out that week, so I got home locked the door and stayed there for two days because I felt so exposed. 
As I look back, that was the best thing that happened to me because finally I decided to let go. I decided to not wear a wig, put on a flowery dress and embrace this as my beauty. I went back to work, completely bald and for the first time in a long time I looked people in the eye as I walked past them…and felt accepted. People thought I did it as a style statement and began to compliment me…I finally felt comfortable in my own skin. I was only hesitant once when I had to wear a sari, but even that worked out well.  I went from a 'why me?' to 'why not?' because of my inner strength and that's something I'm proud of.
You know we hear a lot about what makes a woman - her thick hair, brown eyes or curvy body…but I think a woman is so much more than that. She's strong, relentless and fierce and her outer appearance can never represent all of that.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/459735404235442/?type=3,2016-03-08 00:00:40,108225,2911,22888,102530,4832,828,9,25,1

I was 2 and a half years at that point, but I told my mother I wanted to perform and that's the first time I performed in front of a live audience. I performed a very complex Lata Mangeshkar song and knew that I wanted to sing forever and that's when my training began in classical singing. My brother and I both started singing since before we were 5.
1999 was a defining year for both of us. We were only 6 years old when the Kargil War was going on. During that time, we saw a newspaper ad that asked people to donate for our soldiers and because we couldn't afford a lot, my brother and I went from shop to shop singing 'ae mere Watan ke logo' and ended up collecting 25,000 Rupees for our soldiers. We felt like we had used our talent for something important and we wanted to keep at it. 
Since then, we've been doing 100% charity shows under the name 'Save Little Hearts'. It all began when a poor shoe seller contacted us to help his child Lokesh who had been suffering from congenital heart defect. We organised a small show and thought we would have to perform 5-6 times before we can collect the amount -- but we collected the 55,000 Rupees overnight. Since then we've focused on arranging money for children with heart ailments and over the years we've collected over 3.25 crores for our cause and saved the lives of over 800 children. 
We're all born with some talent or the other but we have a choice on how to use that talent. We don't have to give away all our money...that wouldn't be sensible, but if we can make a difference to humanity in any way we should jump at the opportunity.I A few years ago we sang to save the life of a farmer's son in a remote village in India and when his son's operation was successful he came all the way to meet us with a bag full of wheat...those are the moments which we look back on as special and life changing. I'm 23 and my brother's 20 and we have a long way to go to make sure no child dies of a heart defect, but we're trying and that's all the world needs -- people who care enough to try and make a difference.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/459356440940005/?type=3,2016-03-06 23:57:19,13569,359,1349,12342,1033,191,2,1,0

I tried everything - from trying to date girls and convincing myself out of it to considering seeking psychiatrist help …but nothing helped. Overtime, as I started to read blogs online and confiding in my close friends, I realised that I wasn't abnormal and that I didn't have a disease. 
I'm gay and I've made more than my peace with that. Have I been mocked? Yes. Infact, before I had even understood I was gay, a friend of mine began calling me 'Gaydant' (instead of Vedant) and I felt like never accepting it. There were always rumours that I was gay, so when one girl asked me to my face if I was…I ran away. That's when a close friend of mine told me, 'you will never be able to run away from who you really are - accept it and embrace it' and I think that's when I got some courage.

I was always a good student and had the good fortune of having a sympathetic headmaster at my school, who understood my situation. Everyone in school would have those shiny black shoes, but I was allowed in my tattered chappals, all because I was desperate to learn. Late at night, you would find me reading by a street light while the rest of the people in my slum slept. 
Throughout my journey I've had many angels who have helped me. From my teachers being sympathetic, to people offering to may my fees…I always scraped through. Ofcourse, it wasn't always easy. Being from a background where I couldn't even afford proper meals, my uniform would be torn, my chappals would have holes in it, the other children who were from well off families made fun of me. Even so, I pushed on and chose to look at the good side of life. Once, in the 8th grade a senior of mine came upto me and said, 'do you want a school uniform?' and I nodded…the next day he got me a brand new uniform…and it was these incidents that i hung onto. 
Over summer I would work at petrol pumps and factories to earn some extra money but when I was in the 12th standard I was 50 Rupees short of the fees (which was 150 Rupees back then). The admissions officer said I would have to lose a year and I was heartbroken. As I was walking home, I met a friend at the bus stop and as soon as I told him my situation, he removed a 50 Rupee note then and there and said 'this never happened, you owe me nothing.' 
After my 12th, I interviewed for my dentistry and got accepted in my first round because I was very strong academically. On hearing that someone from the slums has made it through a medicine entrance exam, an MLA from Kurla decided to pay my fees. After this, an NGO called EOTO sponsored my equipment for the next few years and that's how I became a dentist. 
I began working and eventually bought my own space and started my own clinic…and that's when I thought it's the perfect time to give back to the universe, all that it has given me. I started Charitable Dentist Organisation which charges nothing for treatment, from the under privileged. Seeing that a lot of people had oral cancer because of Gutka, I began to spread awareness about this issue to slums. 
Recently, I bought a piece of land in Dahanu, where I hold free different medical camps with my doctor friends for the underprivileged and tribal people. From gynacs, to cardiologists we've all come together to help people who cannot afford our services. My focus was also always to help educate…education has transformed my life and I wanted that for as many children as possible. Over the years, I've distributed over 4000 shoes to children who can't afford it…just so that they're never removed because of attire.

As she kept pressurising me, I went to work and told my friend that I had to get married and we would have to stop meeting. I left, got onto the bus and started crying…but I couldn't understand why. When my stop came and I got off, there he was waiting in a cab. He got out, held my hand and said, 'you can't marry him, you can only marry me' and then he just turned around and left! Well, that was my proposal and it was always a yes…how could I not marry my best friend? We faced a lot of resistance from both our families and my mother didn't even sit through my wedding….but after 52 years let me tell you that it was the best decision of my life! 
I was respected as a woman, allowed to work and given equal rights. In 1983, I was standing at my balcony one day when I saw 5 children in school uniforms sitting on the footpath and playing cards. I kept seeing them everyday, when I went upto them and asked them why they weren't at school. They said, 'We have shabby uniforms so the teacher beats us and doesn't allow us to sit.' My childhood memories came rushing back to me, so immediately I bought them uniforms and paid their fees, but within a week 2 of those children ran away again. I still focused on those 3 and would take home cooked food for them everyday…when someone suggested starting a Trust. With the 900 Rupees I had saved over the years, I started a Trust and soon people started volunteering with me, visiting slums where children weren't studying and enrolled them with us. 
From those 3 students, today, there are over 10,000 such children studying under my Trust and there has been nothing more fulfilling. These children give back once they get jobs either by volunteering or helping us with finances, and let me tell you...our students have gone on to become doctors, lawyers and engineers. Even though I didn't get to go to college, I've lived my every dream through these students and I couldn't have asked for anything more.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/454443498097966/?type=3,2016-02-22 08:37:31,29659,876,3610,29659,0,0,0,0,0

I was treated really badly-- I had to work at that age, I would only sleep at 12:30 at night and have to wake up as early as 4 am to help with the housework. Worse of all, they stopped my education. I began collecting money from whatever I earned, and when I had saved 2000 Rupees, I decided to run away from home. I got onto a train to Delhi and then took a train to Bombay. When I got here, I stayed on the street for days...sleeping at stations or bus stops. 
I was sleeping at CST one day, when a woman came upto me and asked me why I sleeping there. Once I told her my story she took me to Shelter Don Bosco and that's where I grew up and got my education until I failed the 12th standard. That's when I stopped studying and decided to start working.
At 18, they set 4 of us from the shelter up in one flat and got us a job. I've had so many jobs since then -- from being a waiter, to a driver...I've done it all. I got married a few years ago and even had a baby girl who's just turned 3. Being a father changed me...when I see my daughter, I know that I want to educate her and give her the chance to live a good, independent life. I'm having some trouble paying her school fees because she fell seriously ill a few months ago and all our savings were drained. 
Today, I'm working as a security guard at India Bulls, and even though the money is okay for survival, it's not enough for me to support my daughter's education. After all these years, I've decided to finish my schooling-- intact I was just on my way to pick up the 12th standard admission forms. I also want to take a course in security management, so that I can get a higher post and educate my daughter to the best of my ability. I hope I can be a good father...I'm really trying my best. I'm already working 3 shifts, and now staying up late to study...I just want to be a father she can look upto-- I want to make all her dreams come true.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/454021571473492/?type=3,2016-02-21 06:20:39,15405,158,548,15405,0,0,0,0,0

188056068070045_452688818273434,"""I lost my parents very early on and came to Bombay at the age of 6 with a relative. I began begging at signals since that age and eventually became a ragpicker. I've had a tough time on the streets, where I couldn't defend myself on many occasions  and had no food for days -- Bombay isn't friendly to us street rats.  A few years later, when I was rag picking, a man came upto me and asked me if I wanted to work at a chai stall-- and I immediately agreed! I began selling tea, and making my own money after working for almost 12 hours a day.
One evening, I was at a garden nearby when I saw people dressed in black robes practicing how to kick and I found out later that it was Martial Arts. I began observing this class everyday and decided to save money to learn more. When I did, my guru taught me a few techniques but whatever I've learnt is through observing. One of my customers introduced me to Youtube and I began to watch martial arts videos on borrowed laptops and began practicing on my own in this garden.  One day, a small street boy came upto and asked if I would teach him and I gladly agreed. As I began teaching him from whatever I knew, parents who watched became interested to enrol their children and that's how I began to teach Martial Arts.
Although I make a little money from those who can afford it, my main aim is to teach children like me who have no money and no defence for themselves. I teach them for hours, free of cost to give them a career option, because they don't even have money to study. I've also started teaching a group of girls from a nearby slum moves to defend themselves if any one tries to attack or abuse them-- these girls need it the most. Whatever little money I save after rent and food, I invest in buying mats and gear for my children--I have no family so my entire life is for them now. 
So while I'm still working as a chaiwallah, every evening I teach over 70 street children, because I know what I've been through during my days on the street and I don't ever want another child to suffer the way I did-- and guess what? Many of them are even taking part in tournaments all across India...they're that good!""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/452688818273434/?type=3,2016-02-17 07:59:02,41179,1028,5359,41179,0,0,0,0,0

In those times, we couldn't even talk to someone without feeling scared, but I was so comfortable being around him that I didn't even realise how time went by.  The rare moments that we were together, he would hold my hand and I used to feel on top of the world.  As time went by and Independence was around the corner he asked me to marry him saying that 'war was inevitable and he couldn't bear the thought of being separated from me.' We were married in 1947, just when the war between Hindus and Muslims was at it's peak.
Those were terrifying times. We've seen trains full of dead bodies cut and thrown into the sea. We knew that eventually we too would be killed, so we decided to escape. We ran away at night, just the two of us with nothing but the clothes we were wearing and two rotis for the journey. There were men with swords on every street, looking to kill whoever came their way. We knew a Muslim chacha who drove the tanga and agreed to helped us. He drove us through the streets of Lahore, and whenever we were stopped he said that we were his family. He dropped us to the station, we took the train to Amritsar and never looked back. 
When we came to Amritsar, we sold off some of the jewellery I was wearing to start a new life. We didn't even have a house to live in but he was such a smart man that he found work easily…and we slowly started rebuilding our life. A few years later, he bought back all the jewellery we had sold…because he felt so guilty that I had to sell it in the first place.  I've seen the world with him because he loved to travel, but my one wish was that I wanted to go back to Lahore and see the home I grew up in. 
A few years ago, he told me - 'we're going home' and I burst into tears when I saw our train tickets to Lahore. We revisited all the places we'd seen in our younger days and I even found the neighbourhood I grew up in! 
Really, he made my every wish come true. He passed away a few years ago and I miss him everyday in the home he built us with so much love… but we have 5 children, 15 grandchildren and a lifetime of memories to keep me going.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/451658371709812/?type=3,2016-02-14 07:11:10,34338,1284,3174,34338,0,0,0,0,0

At that point, I was seeing someone else so I would just meet him as a friend when everyone was hanging out together. After 12th he moved to Bangalore to study, and we would end up meeting only once a year but somehow we were always in each others lives. When he moved back, all of our friends had started working but I used to have my evenings free and his internship was very relaxed— so we started meeting alone. By this time we were both single, but the idea of liking him hadn't even crossed my mind because I'm Hindu and he's Muslim and it would never work.
I don't even know how it happened, but we would go for long walks, he would hold my hand and it felt right. We would talk everyday for hours but not one of us had mentioned liking each other. In 2008 his grandfather passed away, so for one week he would barely message and obviously couldn't meet. That's when I realised I had feelings for him because I missed him more than I would miss any friend. A few weeks later I asked him what was going on between us, he said - 'I don't know what it is, but I think I want to spend the rest of my life with you.'
""When I told her I had feelings for her, I also explained that we would have to go through a lot to convince our families and that there would be times when we would have to fight to make this happen. She would also have to wait for 4 years until I completed my MBA and was settled enough to ask for her hand — she agreed with everything. 
4 years later, I decided to tell my parents about her and it was a flat out no. They said that they've found a Muslim girl for me to marry. I heard whatever they had to say and said, 'If I don't marry her, I won't marry anyone else because I cannot ruin a 3rd persons life…I won't ever be able to love anyone else.' They said that she will marry someone else and won't wait for me - I said I'm willing to take that chance. This went on for 6 months until they reluctantly said yes.
Meanwhile I went and met her mother who was also very upset with our decision. I told her everything about our relationship, about taking care of her my entire life. I also told her that she wouldn't have to convert to Islam— she could still follow her own religion. After a few more meetings, her parents were convinced but all of her relatives wanted to meet me as well. I went alone to meet her mama and extended family.
Once our parents reluctantly agreed, we decided to get engaged and believe it or not, our parents met for the first time at the engagement -- we were expecting a disaster but it was all very cordial. 
A few months later, my father passed away. It was a very trying time and my mother saw that she was such a big support to me and the rest of my family. She began to see what I had seen in her all along. We got married a few months later, respecting both our religions. After so many years, we finally made it happen. It was a difficult process, but easy because from day one I knew that it was her or nobody else. 
Today, our families are respecting of our different religions — her family celebrates Eid with us, and our family celebrates all their festivals with them.

I was rushed to the hospital, but the doctor said that only if we had 25,000 rupees, my leg could be saved. I came from a family of poor means so this was not even an option. My leg was amputated 6 times and when I was discharged, I realized that life would continue to be difficult. Since that fragile age of 6, I was termed 'langda'. If I wanted to go play football with the other boys, I wasn't even allowed on the field because they said I would damage the field and the ball. My own father thought I was a liability, because being the eldest in the family I was supposed to contribute to the family income-- he would beat me black and blue until I decided to leave home at the age of 15 to earn money and try and become independent.
I had seen these street gangs since a young age so I decided that in order to defend myself and make some quick money I would join them. I started keeping a knife, earning money and beating people. I went to jail three times...it was a dark time in my life but I didn't know what else to do -- I was tired of having no income and constantly being made fun off. in 1994 there was an order to 'shoot me if seen'. This is after they had beaten my mother and put my father in jail. One night when I was in hiding a tall 6 foot man caught me by the shoulder. I went to remove my knife thinking its a cop, but before anything could happen he said, 'My son, Jesus loves you and has a great plan for you.' He held my hand for hours, spoke to me and explained to me that life was not over -- something my own father had never done. I said 'if there's a God, ask him to remove me from this hell.' Since then, he became my guide. He enrolled me in a place for troubled youth, took me to church, kept reading verses from the bible and tried to reform me. I was in the NGO for 2 years and through them I got my Jaipur foot...and that's when I got the confidence to chase my dreams. They have done so much for me that they spoke to the police, explained that I'm still not even 18, but I'm transformed...and they let me off with a last warning. 
During this time, I was given the news that my father passed away. I knew that I wanted to take responsibility for my siblings and mother so I would work at the NGO the whole day, go to evening school from 4-7pm and then work at Mc.Donald's from 7-11 at night...everyday. On weekends I would sell socks and save every penny. This went on for 2 years, until my boss at the NGO told me that he wanted to promote me and I would have to attend a leadership programme in Portugal! I gladly agreed and started making more money.

At that time of the night, no cab stopped for us and that process frustrated me. I gave up my career as an engineer at Larsen and Toubro and began to drive a taxi, free of cost for anyone who needs to get to the hospital. I earn 10,000 rupees a month from general passengers, but my aim is to help those in need at any hour of the day. Whoever sits in my cab gets my card and can contact me even at 3 in the morning with an emergency and I will take them to their destination. 
An incident that pushes me to keep doing this service is one that happened a few months ago. At around 2 in the morning, I saw 2 men on the road frantically waving for a cab. I obviously stopped for them and realized that they had a woman with them who had suffered 75% burns to her body. Many cab drivers before me had refused to take her in their vehicles because of this and that made my heart sink. I gave them a blanket which I keep in my car, asked them to cover her and drove like a maniac to get her to the nearest hospital. For the next few days, I kept checking to know if she had survived -- and by God's grace, she did. We are friends now, and she still thanks me for that night. 
Whether the 26th July floods, or the night of 26/11, I have made sure to reach locations where people need me. I believe that everything is not about money. I was earning 65,000 at my previous job, but I've never been happier than I am today. 
I am 74 years old, can speak 11 languages, have children who work in private equity firms and have the qualification to be an advanced engineer...but the highlight of my life is that until today I have transported more than 500 emergency cases to the hospital and tried my best to atleast  give them a chance to survive. For that, if I am forever called an ordinary taxi driver -- I gladly and proudly accept.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/448972688645047/?type=3,2016-02-07 00:43:07,200315,6628,48833,200315,0,0,0,0,0

188056068070045_448111532064496,"""I've had a passion for drawing cartoons since I was very young. Cartoons have always been a medium of expression for me, because it helps me voice my emotions the best. As I began to actively pursue a career as a cartoonist I got a lot of free lance projects, but in general my political cartoons weren't published because they were too blunt and nobody wanted to get into politics. 
The first time I was furious with Asaram Bapu was when he commented on the Nirbhaya case saying, 'she should have call them brothers and said a Guru Mantra.' Then when the news of him apparently raping young girls came out, I decided to voice my anger. At that point he was missing so I posted a cartoon of his followers asking them to go look for him on the moon and posted it on my personal Facebook account.  Before I knew it, a TV news channel had picked it up and this cartoon was everywhere. I followed them up with many cartoons of him being arrested and humiliated. I thought, if he could make such comments about Nirbhaya and get away, surely no one would have a problem with me. I was wrong.
I began to get death threats to the point where my phone never stopped ringing. So many men have called me and said, 'you defended Nirbhaya and insulted Bapu...now we will rape you like we raped Nirbhaya.' They hacked all my accounts on Facebook, twitter and even my email, to stop me from drawing. For 5 months I was scared to step out of my house because I feared that someone would throw acid at me...given that his followers had even reached my doorstep. 
Through all of this my cartoons continued. When we tried to make a police complaint, they asked me to stop making cartoons until the matter calmed down but I wasn't doing anything wrong, so why stop? Even though I was receiving messages of support, I felt terrified every step I took. I was heavily covered and interviewed and even received an International Award by the CRNI, but I still have a few questions. Why is it so easy to threaten women in this country? Why don't we have any freedom of speech? Why do political idols and personalities feel like they have the power to control everything? Today I've stood up for my honest work, but at what cost? Tomorrow anyone else could be a Nirbhaya, the national will mourn for a few days and then it'll pass...but when will this madness stop?""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/448111532064496/?type=3,2016-02-04 09:30:08,7409,118,708,7409,0,0,0,0,0

At the end of my first year in university, when exams were just around the corner the coordinator comes to our class and asks us to pay for the wi-fi and AC that had recently been installed in our college. A few of us found it really fishy so decided to wait before making any payment for the 'department' that was asking for the money. After a few days she came into our class again and said, you should pay the money because I don't want to be partial in the upcoming exams -- you might just fail if you haven't paid the money. 11,000 Rupees was a lot for someone like me and a lot of other people in class -- so 10 of us decided not to pay. The coordinator actually came to us and started negotiating that if not 11,000 pay 8,000 each. We even agreed to pay provided they give us a written receipt which they refused to do...infact they weren't even ready to take a cheque! We refused. 
We were then threatened that if we didn't pay we couldn't sit for the exams at all -- and that's when we decided to call one of our friends who worked in Mid-day. She asked for proof, which we gave her and Mid-day carried the story. We gave our exams and of course, the 10 people who hadn't paid money all failed! I'm not Einstein, but I had well enough to know that I would definitely have passed. When we asked the coordinator what's going on she said -'now go to the media and show.' We decided that losing a year was too much so we went to a political party for help - they asked us to write letters which we sent out and waited for our trial date. By now 2 out of these 10 people had made donations to the college, so they were passed by the college. Others were scared of being expelled so they decided to just repeat the year...by the end it was just me and my friend. We waited for months but there was no help from this political party - they had stopped answering our calls. We decided to try another political party and when he checked the status of our case hearing he realised it had already passed! Someone had bribed that person to dismiss this hearing and he did...at 18 we were stuck in the middle of this dirty game of bribing and politics. Through this period the college tried slandering our image and called us rapists and drug addicts just to shift the attention from the media -- they even made police complaints and kept us in jail at such a young age. 
Finally this politician really stuck by us and got us justice. My friend and I ensured that not only us, but all those who were unfairly failed were passed as well. By then I had enough and decided to move to a college which was smaller than this one, but gave me admission-- no other college wanted a guy like me.

He lived a little far off, but we would play together occasionally and always be present for each other's birthdays. We didn't tell each other that there were feelings -- but words weren't necessary. At 19 I went off to Cambridge in England to study English and we didn't speak for months...but we were both waiting to see each other.
I finished my education and had been home for some time, when one day I was sitting under a shady tree, reading in the afternoon when he drove in. I thought he was there to see me, but he saw me and marched straight into my house. After a few minutes, when he came out, I asked him what he was doing. He replied, 'I just went in to ask your father if I could marry you and he said the decision was yours...so If I may propose to you, will you please be my wife?' -- of course I said yes! A few months later he went off to fight in the World War II in Burma and those years were the most difficult. We could only communicate through letters-- all of which reached me months after he'd written them. I began to volunteer in the Indian Medical Service just to be close to the war. 
""Fighting the War was terrible...we were surviving on biscuits and preserved foods for years on end. War was brutal and ugly.

There was this one incident in the trenches where I thought I would be shredded to pieces - in fact the reason I'm alive is because a bullet hit my riffle and bounced off it. In those moments I could only think of her and how desperately I wanted to survive to meet her.
When the war finally ended and I was going to meet her at the Guwahati station, my hair had fallen out and I had this yellowish skin-- I wondered if she would still even love me. But when I saw her, she embraced me and said, 'you've never looked more handsome.'

I would go to school, then go for my dance training and be back home only by 9:30 pm...and that's what my early life was about. In my 10th exams, I stood first with 80% but instead of picking science for my further studies, I chose arts...just so that I could continue to dance. By this time I had performed at several events and done hundreds of stage shows...I was just about beginning when life took a strange turn.
I was travelling from Trichy by bus, when we met with a major accident that left me with a fracture and some cuts -- I was probably the least injured there. However, because of the heavy influx of patients, I was attended to by a couple of interns who forgot to attend to the cut on my right ankle and went ahead to wrap it up. This resulted in my foot getting gangrene and because of the fear of it spreading throughout my body, my parents had to take the difficult decision of amputating my right foot. I was shattered because It was only then that I realised just how passionate I felt about dancing. I began to learn how to walk again and it took me 4 months to even walk straight. Once I got the Jaipor leg, it took me 3 years of physiotherapy to recover and feel normal again. I remember people would come home and say things like, 'it's so sad your dreams can't come true' or 'we wish you could dance' when I decided to re-learn what I had known my entire life-- to dance.
It was a slow and painful process but with every step I learnt I knew that this is what I wanted. Finally one day, I went to my dad and told him that I was ready to perform again...and he was shocked! I was to perform in St.Xaviers college on Sunday when the Sunday morning headline read - 'Looses a Foot, Walks a Mile' and the show was completely sold out! I began to get nervous before going up on stage when my Grandmother told me, 'Don't worry, God is with you...let the miracle happen.' but I was so angry that I said, 'If God was with me he wouldn't ever do this to me!"" 
Believe it or not, the show ended, I performed the Varanyam with ease and received a standing ovation. When I was home, my dad came upto me and touched my feet saying that I'm touching the feet of the Goddess Sarasvati because you have done the impossible and that has been the moment that touched me the most. It was after that, that I received so much respect from the media, got an offer to act in a film based on my life and received all of the opportunities that I have today. What my grandmother said was true -- God was with me. Even if I didn't see it then, he was with me all along and that's the irony of life-- that an accident so fatal, can still be a blessing in disguise.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/442103689331947/?type=3,2016-01-18 08:25:43,60111,1293,8708,60111,0,0,0,0,0

He forced me to give him a blow job and proceeded to have anal sex with me, multiple times. At that point, I didn't know what was happening to me, whether it was ok, whether it was normal. I got so used to it, I would enter his house and lie down on the bed, just wanting it to get over as soon as possible. At 12, I began to get gang-raped by his friends, and I would bleed but keep quite...because what if I wasn't considered 'man enough' to not bear pain? My childhood went by having two worlds where I would not remember the rape until something triggered it off and then I would cry endlessly. I would not enter a male washroom because I was scared that I would be raped again...I grew up having no self esteem. 
It was when I was 17 or 18 that I began to understand that what had been happening to me for so many years was wrong--so one day when he came to jump on me, I kicked him and said no. For the first time in 11 years, I said no to being raped. When I told my mother, she was in shock--she asked me why I hadn't told her. I told her I had given her signs, that I had tried but she never picked up on it. She said, 'I never knew such things could happen with boys' and that was the time I realised that boys and men are the forgotten gender. We get abused, but we have no right to voice it because we're supposed to be the protectors. The victims of 'masculinity' are men themselves. I have been bullied for many years for my sexual orientation as well, but when I told my story the same classmates who laughed at me became my biggest strength and helped me to cope with my childhood. A part of me believed that I'm gay because of the abuse I went through and it devastated me, but I know now that that isn't true. 
We tried to get some legal help but we realised that there's no law against child sexual abuse for boys in the country.  By the time I was 18, no laws applied to my case -- so there was no justice. That's when I decided that I would make the motto of my life to protect other children from sexual abuse. 
So I've been through 11 years of hell but I don't think the world is a bad place. I thank my bullies, because they got me here -- where I have the opportunity to touch other's lives. I believe that hate only destroys the hater, not the hated -- so I don't think I hate my uncle. To me, he doesn't exist. Infact If I could, I would send a therapist to help him.

Before that, I didn't know that I wanted to dedicate my life to any cause -- I was just a confused 23 year old who was figuring life out. After I moved on from Akanksha to St. Jude India, I saw death almost everyday. Children who I was spending hours on end with would pass away so suddenly and it hurt more every time it happened. What really bothered me was that children with high survival rate were obviously given preference -- the ones who were beyond that stage weren't. 
I remember this young girl from Orissa who always wanted to speak English and was a part of the centre for sometime. Every morning I would ask her 'how are you?' and she would say 'very fine, thank you'. Her chances of survival weren't great, so she was moved out of the facility where I was in touch with her parents. After 2 weeks of not having met her, I went to the hospital to see her and she was there...looking pale and completely drained. I just smiled and asked her, 'Hi how are you?' and she flashed the biggest smile in the world and said 'very well, thank you!' Her mother said that was the first time she had smiled in 2 weeks and that incident really got me thinking.
I started Happy Feet Home to take care of terminally ill children, who have cancer, HIV or thalassemia and don't necessarily have a high chance of survival. It is India's first hospice and palliative care and the only thing we want to do every single day is to bring a smile to these children and to extend their lives to the best of our abilities.

Recently, there has been a fall out with a co-founder, so Mansi is finding it extremely difficult to manage the finances of her organisation alone. She has only Rs. 35,000 in her bank account and it takes close to 2.15 lacs/ month to sustain themselves. This includes rent, medication for the children, food for the children and salary of the nurses. We have started a campaign to raise 10 lacs for Happy Feet Home to help Mansi and these children out for a few months.

Over the years, I wound sit at my grandfather's shop for which he would pay me 5 Rupees a day--and I saved that money to pay for my education. I had a dream of becoming an IT expert, but because we couldn't afford milk let alone a computer I couldn't pursue it. I decided one night that because my family was close to starvation, I would try and go to Bombay to do something. In 2005, when I was 19 years old I ran away with 1200 Rupees in my pocket.
For 18 days after reaching Bombay, I would sleep at a bus stop outside JW Marriot, eat nothing but Tiger biscuits dipped in water and shower inside these local bathrooms before my interviews. I called every big call centre from a pay phone, but because I couldn't speak English fluently -- none of them even considered me. Finally, I got a job at a small local call centre in Andheri which paid me 1600 Rupees a month which was more than any money I had seen! I shifted into a small sharing room with 5 other people and worked overtime. I didn't know how to use a computer so I would take hours to type a simple message - everyone there would laugh at me, but I used to keep practicing. I enrolled myself in a 21 day English Grammar Course and stayed up all night trying to read every word of newspapers that I took from the office. 
In a short period of 3 months, I had learnt how to type on a computer (which I had never even seen before) and spoke good enough English-- and that's how I got my 2nd job with another call centre which paid me 8000 Rupees a month. I was so interested in computers that I would take night lessons to understand the hardware and software of these machines and over the course of a few months I had more knowledge than anyone else in the IT department.
In 2007, I got a job at Microsoft in the service department and eventually I even went on to work with Big Rock which had Google as a client. That was the year I returned home with money for my family - to renovate dad's office, buy a television and washing machine for mom as well as a computer for my brothers. In 4 days I came back, motivated to make it on my own. I quit my job after a few months and started my own company with one employee. Our first client paid us 15,000 Rupees for a website and after that there was no looking back. I've made countless websites, IOS apps and serviced thousands of computers to get to this point. What's funny is that one of my employee's the same guy who made fun of me not knowing English at my first job!

He passed away in a car accident suddenly in 1975 and all of a sudden I was the head of the family with 10 people to support. I educated his children like mine, gave them the same pocket money and took care of them like my own and all my income was because of this taxi here.
As all the children grew older, they took up part time jobs and eventually went on to get amazing job offers. My son is an MBA graduate who lives in London, my daughter has married in Canada and 4 of my brother's children are in Canada as well. My son was dating a girl from London, so when he told me that she's visiting us here in Bombay I was worried that she might not want to marry a taxi driver's son. When she came here and met our family, she said that she had never felt so loved before. They got married soon after and she often calls me and tells me to come to live with them in London. I've picked up some English from her, so I tell her - 'save your money - I'm working here very happily.' I also ask her if she'll get such good Sarso da Saag in London - to which she says she's learning how to cook! My son even tells me, 'Baba, it's our turn to give you pocket money now' but I laugh it off.
My life has been very simple. I'm 75 and still working because I believe that man should work as long as he can -- what good are your days of sitting around?

My father's mother has never picked my sister or me up...she would look through us like we didn't exist. Every night my father would drink and beat my mother up for having girls, or some other vague reason and this went on for 7 years.

When I entered the ticket office, the seniors there abused me for chasing them away, saying it was 'just a short circuit', but then another bomb exploded right outside where we were. Through the window I saw Kasab, and thought it was a commando with 2 AK47 guns in his hand. I frantically called out to him for help, but when he saw me he hurled such abuses that I can't even repeat them…and then fired rounds of bullets inside the ticketing counter. The Railway Master was hit, I was injured because of the glass pieces and there were 7-8 other men injured. 
After a few minutes, the firing was coming from some distance, so I got up and crawled outside to see countless bodies - some dead, some still having life in them. I called my wife at that point and told her that I might die because there could still be bombs at the station. She asked me to leave and go home, but I told her that I had to help my people. I've checked almost every body at CST for a sign of life, put people who were still breathing on haath gaadis, slabs of steel drawers and into cabs to be taken to the hospital. I took the Railway Master and a few others to a hospital in Byculla myself, because there were rumours that hospitals in South Bombay like Cama were also under attack. I stayed at CST the whole night with one other police officer.

I knew I wanted to be a pilot and serve the country since the age of 5, so I worked towards it and found myself a place in the IAF without an army background.

For us, the country has always come first, but these bureaucrats and government officials have made it all a money game. Just recently, I met a man who was the Army General during our time and because he wasn't given any pensions on time - he had been reduced to begging. India is the only country who treats its Armed Forces and War Veterans so shabbily - it's shameful, utterly shameful. When Prince Charles came to India, before first visiting the Raj Bhavan, he went to the cemetery to pay respects to those who had lost their lives during war — and that's the kind of respect they deserve.

I started the Institute of Aviation and fought with the chancellor who insisted on having the 'religion' column on application forms. I fought against it and made sure that there was only one question asked - Indian or Non-Indian, and that's how it should be. I've fought wars with my Muslim brothers side by side, and never once questioned differences in our religion, because we're Indian first.

188056068070045_416775711864745,"""His family and my family have lived in the same building for years but since his business was in Bombay and Dubai, I barely saw him. This one day, he asked my driver which college I was studying in, he came there, waited for me to finish class and asked me to coffee. We ended up chatting for an hour that day and I was completely enamoured by him — he was such a charmer! His parents wanted us to marry quickly because he was 7 years older - so at 19 I got married to someone who I thought was the man of my dreams…but he was an asshole. 
It started at the honeymoon, where I wasn't allowed to look anywhere but towards him, wasn't allowed to enter shops which he didn't like and was supposed to wear only what he wanted me to. We were to visit our relatives in London, so he asked me to wear a salwaar but no jacket…and I remember freezing. When we went back to Dubai, he didn't allow me to turn on the AC and if I did in the middle of the night because it was so hot - he would smash my perfumes, candles and upturn my entire wardrobe. He would drive his convertible car at the maximum speed and threaten to throw me out if I ever disobeyed him. Once, in between abusing and screaming at me, he pinned me down, forced himself upon me and 6 months into my wedding I was pregnant. He hid my medicines saying I don't need them — I was throwing up 30 times a day and all the minerals in my body had drained to the point that I couldn't stand and that's when he agreed to take me to the hospital. The nurse there saw me once and said 'I've to take you to the emergency room - and had you come a day later you would return to Bombay in a coffin'. When I went home after those 3 days, he pushed me, I started bleeding and he waited 24 hours to take me back to the hospital. On the hospital slip it said 'bled yesterday and brought to the hospital today.'
He only let me return home because my parents were at Hajj. When I came home, I asked him if I could stay for a night in my own home instead of his - which he flatly refused. I was talking to my mother on the phone for 15 minutes when he called me 40 times, sent his sister upstairs to snatch my phone and sent me a text saying,'If you return to Dubai, I will rip your ass apart' in Hindi. That's when I decided I had enough.
The next 6 years were hell for me. He sent me a legal notice saying he wanted custody of my unborn child, but I would never let that happen. So 30 days after I had delivered and my stitches hadn't healed - I went to the family court to fight for my son. My son has been to more courtrooms in the first 5 years of his life than most people ever would. He bribed people from the court and the judges to prolong this case and if not for this one police man who understood me and helped me - God knows how much longer I would have to continue my fight. In 2012, my hell was finally over. I won all cases because of that one hospital slip and received nothing in compensation from him or his family. He seemed so normal, but he snatched my innocence away. Please, don't rush into marriage because so often what people appear to be and who they are, is entirely different. 10 years later, I've put it behind me because I have my son and my life is for him. He's all that matters.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/416775711864745/?type=3,2015-10-23 08:01:52,62521,3637,10038,62521,0,0,0,0,0

When we were well settled, I made a great investment in a plot of land in Karjat and got myself 2 dogs to keep me company on the weekends.

My idea was to make them feel as normal and a part of society as possible - so the magazine entails information on cool new apps, fashion trends, Bollywood updates, advertisements from Tata Group to Coca Cola and yes, even a subscription fee. More often than not, we treat them as charity cases - when all they really want is to pay for things and do things the way we normally do.

After working in Delhi at a Leather workshop for a few months, I reached Bombay and moved into Dharavi where I shared a room with a few village boys and worked at a leather factory. I was always entrepreneurial, so on weekends I would make mobile covers and sell them at VT station. I painfully saved Rs. 25,000, but like so many in Bombay I got conned of the money and chased the culprit to Bangalore – all in vain. I started doing odd jobs in Bangalore and over time made a friend, Jacob. He took me to Salsa class one day and that decision changed my life – I fell in love with dance. 
When I finally returned to Bombay, I continued working at the labor factory, but began attending Sandip sir's dance classes (after he agreed to let me pay the fees in installments.) One day, Sandip Sir asked me if I could make 'dancing shoes' for him – which back in 2000 were only available abroad. I said,  'yes, let me try' and that's when this dream turned into reality for me. Obviously the first few pairs were disastrous, but I saw a market for it and what's more...I realized that I had a great advantage. I had easy access to all the raw materials needed, because they were all available in Dharavi itself. I quit my job in 2005 and started making professional dancing shoes full time. By 2007, I bought this small space in Dharavi, which is my workshop and started supplying my shoes all over…infact my shoes have been worn by all of Bollywood including Priyanka Chopra and Hrithik Roshan. 
Today, I make enough money to support my brothers who are in school and it's my dream to see them fully educated. As for me, I can't help but smile.

When I finally decided to start blogging, I had only one purpose – to show a side of Bombay that not many people knew existed. Growing up abroad, people would ask me, 'do you own an elephant?' That's how clueless they were about life in India (but boy wouldn't it be cool to own an elephant!) I know Bombay is also home to massive slums, and we have our share of suffering and poverty - but that's not the only thing that defines Bombay and I wanted to show the world what else we have to offer. In the end, the way I look at it, we're only here for a short time. What really matters is how we loved. From loving what we do, to loving others around us, it's the only thing that makes everything worth it.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/humansofbombay/photos/a.188058468069805.1073741828.188056068070045/331041417104842/?type=3,2015-02-02 23:03:09,7391,199,194,7391,0,0,0,0,0

There was no bleeding - just a burning sensation; so I got up, put myself in a cab and went to Bombay hospital where the doctors were all shocked that I was walking. I slipped into a coma and was declared 'dead' on 27th November, but my organs began healing, I came out of my coma and by mid December I was on my two feet and working at that very restaurant.
Two things I will always be grateful for - first is the kindness extended to not only me but all the victims by Mr. Ratan Tata and the Taj Group who showed so much sensitivity and support to us all. When I told them that my medical insurance would cover the cost of all my surgeries - they were diligent enough to notice that insurance wouldn't cover taxes and on the day of my discharge when I went to clear that bill, I was told it was already paid for.

We were outside the small side entrance of Leo's, where the door is - to access the staircase, just standing there when we heard what we thought were fireworks. I mean we had never heard gunshots before so were confused with the sounds and the small flashes of light that accompanied them. 
Just about then, a guy walked out holding his neck because he was bleeding profusely. Our instinct was to go towards him to help him but he was just yelling at us asking us to run and get out of that place. We stood there for a few seconds but he kept screaming at us saying he was fine and to leave. My heart was racing as we turned around and robotically started moving away but during that whole time I could hear this man, shouting at bystanders to get out of the way and save their lives.

Bombay responded to the terrorist attack as it always does, hands tied behind its back, it's authorities asleep at the wheel while facing murderous thugs, with a staggering indifference to the fear of death and as for the people of Bombay...they showed an undying spirit like they always do.
I am alive today because of the Taj Staff and the commandos. On at least three occasions, I was saved by the remarkably brave Taj staff members. First, when they bolted the banquet hall doors of the Crystal Room where i was just before the terrorists were outside the hall. Then, when the evacuation went horribly wrong in the early hours of November 27, when the terrorists found us in the Chambers corridor because politicians had given away our position on live television and started shooting directly at us. For the next many hours, these young professionals were right there with us, hiding in one on of Chamber's meeting rooms, keeping us hopeful, keeping us alive. 
A taj Staff woman came back into the Taj to show the commandos our location, and as we left we all got emotional when we saw the blood and destruction in their hotel, but they put on a brave face and ushered us to move forward.  When we were brought out to the entrance of the Taj, the terrorists started shooting at us again and the cops who were supposed to escort us ran for cover while the Taj employees formed a human circle around us to prevent us from getting shot or hurt during stampeding.
These were ordinary individuals being extraordinarily brave when many whose job it was to protect us, had failed.They were all citizens of Bombay that day. They exemplify hospitality. it wasn't their job. it was what they believed they wanted to do. They could have left us there to die and found their way to safety, but they chose to stay. I cannot comprehend their bravery but i am in generous awe of it and in their perpetual debt. They shone a light on the finest elements of humanity on a dark and bloody day. I will stand with them today. I will stand with them always.

We understand that this is an open forum, where people are entitled to their own opinions and beliefs (which we highly respect), but It's only fair of us to ask you guys to show a little more compassion towards people who are sharing incidents/experiences of value to them, with us.

He looked so happy with what he was doing. He accommodated himself so perfectly in that place. He was particularly remarkable amongst all other things. He said to me -

Tight rope walking requires the same amount of skill, focus and balance as any other art. And yet, nobody recognizes this. People give me money out of sympathy for the poor. I want them to simply enjoy my craft and reward that. But I don't have the freedom to make them realize this. I cannot refuse what they give me regardless of the sentiment behind their action.

Suddenly a middle aged man kicked her and told her to move. She moved herself to the corner of the staircase and as the 11:35 train arrived, she along with me got on to the 1st class ladies compartment. She sat on the floor of the train and continued to struggle to apply the henna. She looked over at me and smiled, I smiled back. I gestured to her to come next to me, she resisted but then agreed. There was no vocal conversation, just hand and face gestures. 
I took the cone from her hand and held her palm and manage to draw a flower. She kept looking at me with pursed lips and once I finished she smiled at me, nodded in approval and kept looking at her hand in awe. Since it was a fast local, the next stop was Bandra, a female police officer entered the compartment and told her to leave. She instantly sprung up, still looking at her hand, with the biggest smile on her face- and left the train. 

It was and will be one of the happiest days of my life which made me feel so grateful for what I have and at the same time made me realize that it isn't always about buying food or things for the under privileged - it's about the compassion you show toward them.

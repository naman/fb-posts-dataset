Medics, civilians and journalists that rushed to the scene were struck with airstrikes that killed another two people including a medic.  The White Helmets reported that the rescue operation to save their comrades lives was targeted with more than 10 airstrikes.

This was a deliberate attack to kill the White Helmets for saving lives. The volunteers names are:

Abu Mahmood lives in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus that has been under siege for four years. He used to own a big vegetable market in Damascus, but he can't access it because he is not allowed to leave his town. 

Abu Mahmood starts his days very early. He needs time to make the long walk to buy food from the local market.

 His trolley is his mobile shop, which he uses to sells beans. He can't sell much because his trolley is small, but he hopes to sell enough each day to make enough money to support his wife and grandchildren.  Abu Mahmood lost one son in a bombing, and another son was arrested by the Syrian regime.  

For Abu Mahmoud, walking to the market every day is an act of courage.  He knows that he is taking the risk of getting killed or injured by regime bombing, but he still wakes up every morning, and pushes his trolley down the streets of his besieged home.

Life carries on in Syria.

Madaya has been cut off from the world for nearly two years. It is under one of the tightest regime sieges in Syria - surrounded by 12,000 landmines and over 60 checkpoints. Almost no food or medicine has been allowed in, and residents have not been able to leave. 

Residents who have nothing to do with the fighting have been living under unimaginable conditions. Starvation. Epidemics. Checkpoints and Snipers. Shelling. 

But creativity and resilience has kept them alive. 

Doctors improvised surgical tools, performed operations by mobile phone light. Engineers connected bicycles to batteries in order to power mobile phones, others melted plastics to make fuel.

Underneath all of this resilience is a deep love and solidarity with others who are suffering the siege.

Despite the horror they have experienced, they are heartbroken to leave Madaya -  the only home they have ever known.

Then the second team arrived, and we started to rescue the wounded and injured. There were so many affected. The situation required a response far beyond our means and we couldn't rescue everyone. We resorted to using fire hoses to wash the deadly chemicals from children's bodies.

That chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun was only the beginning. Four hours later our rescue teams were targeted in several areas. Our centre in Khan Shaykhun itself was hit by six airstrikes, and the nearby Al Rahma hospital was struck by four. Both were completely destroyed. There were attacks throughout Idlib province which paralysed our teams and our ability to respond.

The images in the media showing our teams responding to the chemical attack provoked a violent reaction from the Syrian regime. Several more teams and centres were deliberately targeted. On Friday, our centre in Jisr al Shughur was hit, killing two of our volunteers and injuring three. One of the strikes was so severe that we couldn't find the body parts of our colleague to bury him.

The world has now moved on from thinking about our chemical weapons victims. 

All the talk is now about the strikes against Shayrat air base, the one used in the poison gas attack. We hoped that targeting that air base would limit the killing. But we notice that the strike hasn't been taken seriously and yesterday regime warplanes took off from the very same airbase. 

To protect civilians in Syria we need all of these planes to be stopped. 

While they fly, the regime continues to bomb civilians with all kinds of weapons. There have been more than 120 chemical attacks in the past few years, not to mention the use of banned weapons like cluster bombs and 'bunker busters' in residential areas. 

We need safe areas in Syria so that we can get our lives back. People here want neighbourhoods where their children can go to school, where some semblance of normal life can return.

We need swift, serious, and genuine steps from countries around the world to bring to justice those who used chemical weapons against civilians in Khan Shaykhun, Ghouta, and so many other places in Syria.

It is my sincere hope that for the first time in more than six years, the world will listen to Syrian civilians and take steps to stop this killing for good.

As always, thank you for your solidarity.""

Who are we?
We are Syrian families demanding freedom for all the country's sons and daughters.
These demands are not just for our own families, but for every Syrian family with a detainee.
Our position is against enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention by the Syrian regime and all parties to the conflict.
We want to mobilise the public to pressure all sides to comply with our demands.
We will continue to expand our collective effort to include the largest number of families, regardless of their affiliations.

Our demands
We, as families, demand the immediate release of our relatives who have been unlawfully detained, and until then, we call for the following:
Pressure the Syrian regime and all warring sides to immediately release a list of names of all detainees, along with their current locations and statuses, and to immediately stop torture and mistreatment. In the case of death of a detainee, a death certificate along with a report on causes of death and burial location must be presented to the families 
Pressure the Syrian government to allow international humanitarian organizations to immediately deliver food and medical aid, and to grant international rights groups access to detention facilities to closely monitor living conditions in order to guarantee civil detention facilities to meet healthy living standards

I was 16 when the revolution started. In the first few years of the uprising I saw a lot of foreign photojournalists and TV crews come to document what was happening in my city of Aleppo. I watched them dreaming that I could do that: tell the story of my city and my people. When I saw the work of the White Helmets, I knew that was the story of Syria I wanted to tell to tell the world.                  

The White Helmets have a motto taken from the Quran: ""to save a life is to save all humanity"". I started to document their work as a volunteer to show the world that everyday Syrians were pulling humanity from the rubble of bombs.  

When the bombs fall I follow the teams to the scene. I watch as they use diggers, cranes, the drills, their hands -- anything that can help rescue those trapped. It is my job to remain calm, to capture the reactions from people recovering from the shock of seeing their homes, families, lives buried under rubble. I try to focus on capturing their stories.

The media is so important for the White Helmets and other humanitarian groups working in Syria. We want people to see and understand what is happening: who is doing the killing and who is working for peace. I do this work because I believe if the world understands the suffering of my people they will be moved to stop it; to stand with us on the side of life. 

In November 2015, the director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara contacted us about making a documentary. They had seen the rescue missions we shot and wanted to tell our story to the world. We watched their other films and understood they are people who know how to tell the stories of heroes. I hoped that we could work together to create a film that would tell the true story of the White Helmets to people around the world.

I worked with the team in Adana while they were shooting at the White Helmets training ground. I learnt a lot from the cinematographer Frank Dow about how to shoot, to edit, to tell the story. By the end my notebook was full.

It is so important that people see the film. It is important that people understand that Syria has people who want the same things they want: peace, jobs, family, and to live without the fear of bombs. This is what I hope the film does.

I plan to travel to LA next week for the Oscars where the film is nominated for an award. If we win this award, it will show people across Syria that people around the world support them. It will give courage to every volunteer who wakes up every morning to run towards bombs.

If I cannot enter the US, I will not give up: we know that we have many friends in US, that there are people that share our humanitarian values. I look forward to meeting them all one day. 

When this war is over I dream of going back to study film -- we Syrians have many, many more stories to tell.

In peace,

Khaled

Yesterday the first buses arrived to take civilians who have been forced from their homes in Aleppo by the siege and aerial attacks. Around 5000 people left the city to the countryside of Aleppo.

Residents had been told all civilians remaining would be given safe passage but today the process stopped.

A convoy that left this morning was stopped by a Hezbollah checkpoint. Soldiers and tanks advanced towards the convoy, encircled it, expelled the Red Crescent and ICRC and started firing at it. 4 people were killed and six injured. The convoy was held hostage for hours and all civilians had their remaining possessions taken. White Helmet's vehicles and ambulances were confiscated. All those on the convoy were then forced to walk back into besieged Eastern Aleppo, traumatized.  

It's hard to get an exact number but upwards of 50,000 civilians remain trapped in Eastern Aleppo city. It's dark, cold, there is no food and people are waiting on the streets terrified.

These people are being left to face death, and we don't even know if they will be able to tell the world what is happening. Whatever happens the world can never, ever say we didn't know. 

Meanwhile, European Governments and America are standing by whilst this horror unfolds.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1241714305920580/?type=3,2016-12-16 12:19:10,2399,160,2400,685,4,8,1,1107,594
607756062649744_1240643422694335,"On the day evacuations of East Aleppo begin, here's a reflection from Ibrahim, a White Helmet, on why he wants to be the last person to leave:

""My last rescue operation was two days ago. I had a moment of joy when we saved a little baby boy - just 20 days old. We managed to save his mother but his father and three siblings died under the rubble. The baby is not safe yet, he needs medicine but there isn't any. He needs a father but now he has none. 

When I saw the little baby boy pulled from the rubble I thought of my own son, Laith, who is just 10 months old.

We had to flee our home four days ago when the Regime took over. We left everything behind, even Laith's toys. Now he and my wife are sheltering close to the White Helmets centre.  I know I can run to them if the place gets attacked.  Laith needs vaccines and food. If I live it will be to look after him. 

Whatever you see in the headlines, and whatever hell it is in this moment, I love Aleppo. I was born here. I studied here. I first fell in love here. I got married here. I watched my son be born here.

Aleppo is the home of our struggle for freedom and dignity, the most just of causes. I want my son to hear about it, I want him to fall in love with it, I want him to know the story of Aleppo as the university of our revolution.

I believe what is happening here has never happened anywhere, it is a mix of the best of humanity and the worst. 

I want to stay, to be the last person to leave Aleppo. As a White Helmet I have seen things that most people can not imagine: burning bodies, children suffering from chemical weapons, weeping mothers. I have lost friends and family members, but leaving Aleppo will be the hardest thing I have ever done. 

Wherever I end up I will keep being a White Helmet. Syria needs us. I believe in our mission and I believe in saving lives, not taking them. I hope one day my son will also be proud of my story.""

Please read it, then share his message. 

""For the past four years, we the Syria civil defence (or White Helmets), have saved thousands of lives in Aleppo. In the last few days we can no longer even count the dead. We have been asking for a safe passage for all civilians, and on Tuesday we heard that a deal had been agreed. People waited all night in the streets with the rain falling for this evacuation, but today they are being shelled once again and it is bombs that are raining down.

About 100,000 civilians are trapped in besieged eastern Aleppo in a rapidly shrinking space – less than a few square kilometres. On Tuesday, they went through hell - people were shot on sight and hundreds of children were trapped in the crossfire. Hundreds of people remain crammed into small spaces, meaning any new direct strike will hit dozens if not hundreds of people. Bodies are lying on the ground where they have fallen or trapped under the rubble. Civilians have been sheltering underground for days. Without a safe passage, death or detention seem to be the only way out of this nightmare.

Inside this small enclave are those who chose to remain to protect civilians: members of the White Helmets, the doctors and nurses who have rebuilt hospitals countless times, the teachers who moved classrooms into basements to keep Syria's future alive, and the journalists who revealed the truth about what's happening. All of these people have been systematically targeted by the Syrian regime and its allies for years. It follows then that if these people are left unprotected, they will be the first to be detained or killed.

And so we repeat our request: Aleppo's humanitarians are calling for safe passage for all civilians, and those that serve them, out of Aleppo. Yesterday we learned about a deal to get all 100,000 civilians across the four kilometres to Western Aleppo and into some sort of safety: with a few dozen buses and lorries they could all be evacuated in 24 hours. However, this has not happened. We need the international community to pressure those who have blocked the deal. Can anyone country really say it has done everything in its power to stop these massacres?

The countryside around Aleppo where they would be sent is still not ""safe"": Russian and regime bombs drop daily. But at least there is no siege there, and parents are not watching their children being killed in front of them.

I have travelled to dozens of parliaments and spoken about every type of death facing Syrians. But often people want to know about what it feels to save a life. I ask the friends of Syria to have that experience today – by doing everything possible in their power to evacuate these 100,000 souls.""

100,000 civilians remain trapped in an area of five kilometres squared. These civilians need URGENT evacuation. 

Please read and share this message from Eastern Aleppo: 

The bombs are falling as we write this. For years our humanitarian volunteers have worked to save the lives of our people in Aleppo: operating in underground hospitals, rescuing entire families buried under the rubble, and risking our lives to document the daily war crimes committed by the Assad regime and its ally Russia. We can do no more. 

Now we are with 100,000 civilians trapped in an area of 5 squared kilometres with the non-stop bombs, shells, and advancements on the ground. In one building, more than 500 people are sheltering. People have been underground for days. 

We are calling on you in the International Community to provide a safe passage out of Aleppo for the remaining 100,000 people. We know that the UN has a plan to get us out across the 4 kilometres of Western Aleppo to safety: with a few dozen buses and lorries we could all be evacuated in twenty four hours. However, we need you to guarantee the safety of their workers and our own.

If we stay we fear for our lives. The women may be taken to camps, the men disappeared and anyone who is known to have supported civilians will face detention or execution. We've watched thousands of our boys and men be detained. Countless White Helmets, doctors, nurses, and humanitarians have been targeted and killed in the regime's cruel assault on Aleppo. The regime has been trying to kill us for five years. Please don't give them this chance.

We can not believe that the world's most powerful countries cannot get 100,000 souls four kilometers to relative safety.

""My name is Alaa Ali Alewi, I was born in 1985 in Aleppo.

I used to have my own tailor shop, but I couldn't stand by and just watch people getting injured in the streets so I became a volunteer ambulance driver. You need to have a  fearless heart to do my job because when you enter an area that's being bombed, you take the risk of never coming back alive.

But people need my help and I want to do anything I can to help them. The feeling I get from saving lives has made me fearless.

Before the non-stop bombing began, I used to go to work, drink a coffee with my colleagues, and wait all day for just one phone call. Nowadays, we are so overwhelmed with injuries we can't distinguish between night and day.  

Two days ago, I almost got killed twice. I got a rescue call and was headed to Al Salheen neighbourhood when the regime hit the area with a ""double-tap"" strike. My ambulance almost got hit by the bombing both times. Thank God, I had the chance to live another day to see my family.

Recently, I leave my home and my daughter always asks me to promise her that I'll  come back home safely. I say goodbye to her and my wife not knowing if I can keep this promise.

No one can can promise anyone anything these days. Everything can change within a few seconds, one bomb can change your life forever.

When I transport the injured, I always think that the person could easily be my friend, my wife, my daughter, it could be anyone. 

With all the bombing that's happening every hour here, it is too hard to save all of the the injured people. I've had a lot of situations where someone in my ambulance is taking his or her last breath, and there is nothing I can do. I keep driving, searching for the closest medical point, but it's too hard to find one because the locations keep changing due to the bombing. 

Recently, we haven't been able to get fuel for our ambulances. Almost all of the injured are being taken to medical points by bicycle or wagons that are normally used for selling vegetables.

It's a scene that cannot be described... People pushing bodies in a wagon covered in blood, screaming ""Where is the nearest medical point? Please I need someone help me push… Someone help me find a doctor please, he/she is dying!""

And suddenly, the screaming stops and the patient is lost. 

It is almost impossible to take any injured person to a medical point unless it's close by. Anyone who gets injured by a medical point feels lucky, as if they have just won the lottery - the prize of life.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1233049450120399/?type=3,2016-12-09 09:58:33,879,42,647,358,15,3,0,435,68

""When we were on our way home from school, the air force targeted our school with a rocket. It landed very near to our school. The force of the blast propelled me a few meters and I was left with some shrapnel in my body. Nothing serious. My friend and teacher were killed and I couldn't do anything to help them. 

The medics had to take me to the hospital. I was conscious of what was happening around me. I saw them lying on the ground but I couldn't  move. There was blood covering the street that we used to take from our homes to school. I saw death in front of me.

A week passed by. I didn't know what was happening around me. I didn't speak to anyone. The shock of losing my friend and teacher was too much to bear

After this painful incident, I ran out of feelings about anything. I lost my sense of pain.

My neighbour was killed a couple days after. I saw his body parts. My eyes have become used to seeing death.

When you enter any medical point in east Aleppo, you see bodies and blood all around you. You can't feel anything anymore. The screaming and crying is the only thing that  awakens the humanity in you again.

People in Aleppo are really tired, especially after the recent regime offensive on Eastern Aleppo. People's spirits are down.

The world went completely silent even though everyone knows exactly what's happening in Syria, especially in Aleppo.

After more than 100 days days of the siege and non-stop bombing no one has done anything. All of the meetings denouncing the atrocities happened in vain.

I wish the world could be inside Aleppo for just one day, living with us under bombing and siege, to feel our suffering. No one can handle it.

Please try to push your governments to do something, anything. Please put pressure on the international community. The world's silence is a stain on the Security Council and humanitarian organizations. This feeling of helplessness is a shame for those fighting for human rights.

""I moved to the regime controlled part of Aleppo in June 2014 when I started studying Aviation Engineering at University. I used this student life as a cover for six months whilst I reported on regime crimes. It was a risky decision, I could have been arrested or exposed. Thankfully I have a strong heart. Aleppo is our city and I believed it's our duty to protect it by documenting these crimes.

I left Aleppo for a while on a scholarship to Turkey but I returned when the first siege started in 2015. I couldn't stay in Turkey any longer; my mind was in my city and my country.

In life before the siege, I used to wake up, drink coffee, eat biscuits, and drive to work. I didn't experience the psychological stress I do today. We used to find everything we wanted in the markets. Due to the current siege, there is nothing left in the markets. Nowadays, we only eat thyme and drink tea, if it's available.

The only way to get from one place to another is by walking because there is no fuel left. Photographers are no longer able to cover everything that is happening around us. The bombing never stops and there is no transportation left in the city.

It's really hard to work on rushes of footage of body parts and blood. In the beginning, it's impossible to finish but you know you have to continue so you can show the world what's happening. After a while, these images become normal.

I am not afraid of the bombing, hunger, or injury. But when my little brother asks me for food or sweets or when my mother tells me she is afraid or you feel afraid for your family being injured then I feel scared and as though life has no meaning. When you are away from home and you hear that there is a bombing or shooting close to your house, you can't just  leave your job and go home. You worry and your heart won't calm itself down until you know your family is ok.

Even though we got used to the bombing, we are innately afraid of hearing the sound of a plane. We always run to the closest thing to protect us from the bombing. Recently, we can see the pilots inside the planes because they fly so low. You feel like the pilot is coming to snatch lives and leave. The sound of a plane approaching and the sound of machine guns firing are the sounds that take away life.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1229975507094460/?type=3,2016-12-07 03:29:05,480,22,280,203,3,2,0,229,43

They are faced with only two choices: death by bombing, hunger and cold, or flee to regime areas and risk being killed by a sniper or another type of death that happens in regime areas.

Some of the civilians fear that they will be raped by regime soldiers. It's one of the torture tactics the regime uses. We've had reports that men who have crossed into regime territory are facing execution or being told they have to serve in the military.   ‬

The families ‬who decided to go to neighborhoods controlled by the opposition have become internally displaced people. They are‬ facing incredible challenges‪,‬ living on the streets‪,‬ with little help‪,‬ except a couple people. Most of them don't have anywhere to stay‪,‬ no food‪,‬ or clothes‪.‬

Every injured person in Eastern Aleppo is faced with the possibility of death now, because the regime bombed all of the hospitals.‬ In the end, some families chose to go to regime areas, knowing that at least they can find hospitals there.

Abdel Moneim is 24 years old. He writes to you about what it's like living under siege in Eastern Aleppo. This is part two of his story  - please read it and share.

""We are now in a basement which is safer but we are still scared. Lately, the regime has targeted Aleppo with chlorine gas. Yesterday, they hit a location nearby and the smell of chlorine  reached our basement. I've been thinking about how we would escape from the basement if we were targeted. My family can't walk because of their injuries. It takes me more than five minutes to walk 15 meters.

My cousin changes our bandages every day but it's very hard to find medicine. We couldn't tell my mother that her son and grandson had died until yesterday. My mother suffers from blood pressure and diabetes and takes blood pressure medication. We waited to get her pills before we told her and it took us four days to find them.

The siege means that it is getting worse every day, we have a shortage of food and all of the necessities of life. After our house got bombed, we lost everything.

Most of the people here are living on the their remaining food supplies. We hardly get bread, which is available only for 4 days a week. 1 small loaf for each person in each day. Supplies are running out quickly. People can't buy food from the market because of the high prices and because it is nearly impossible to go to the market because of the bombs. Food will run out quickly. 

This is the first time I have spoken about what happened since the incident.  My mother is next to me, so i don't want her to feel any sorrow. You have to be strong not weak. I haven't sat alone yet. I haven't had the time to be alone and feel the sorrow of losing my brother, my nephew, and my friend Mustafa. I couldn't see my brother or my nephew, not even a goodbye. I was in the hospital when they were buried. 

For me human beings can not be divided. How can we airdrop aid to some areas and not other? How can we let Russia protect some people and attack others? I want to ask humanity what are you doing for us in Eastern Aleppo?

Humanity does not mean that you deliver me aid or secure a path for the injured to be evacuated. Humanity must propel us to break the sieges and stop the bombs. We have no time for half-solutions. If we have aid but the regime still bombs us 24 hours a day, what good does that do? If we are bombed do you think not being hungry will matter at that moment?

A great sadness fills my heart. But to be able to cope with this situation, you must have a heart of stone, no feeling. We can't handle it. We postpone our sorrow for a later time. There is no time for sadness in light of all this tragedy.

No human mind can handle this suffering""

Abdel Moneim is 24 years old. He writes to you about what it's like being stuck under the rubble of an airstrike. This is part one of his story - please read it and share.

""My name is Abdel Moneim. I am 24 years old. I live with my family in the Tarek Al Bab neighbourhood of besieged Aleppo.

Last Friday my family and I were at home when a rocket targeted my family's house. I was on the third floor when the bomb hit but they found me on the ground floor trapped under rubble. I was still conscious and I could hear the screams of my nieces. I struggled to free myself to help them but I was completely stuck. I tried to move some of the rocks, but more fell on top of me. The dust made it hard to breathe and I began to suffocate. 

I was the last person to be pulled from under the rubble after my mother and sister. My  brother Mohammed was killed along with my nephew. They did not find my nephew's body, just a few of his body parts. They had to collect the remains of his body with a blanket to bury him. He was 13 years old.

When I reached the hospital it was hell. The injuries in the hospital were horrific and people's screams filled the hallways. I suffered from broken bones in my chest and a broken knee and ankle - not serious injuries compared to the others coming into the hospital.  I didn't get any medication in the hospital because of the shortages. 

At that time there were only two hospitals remaining in Aleppo. The day I was there, the hospital got bombed. Thankfully I wasn't inside when it was bombed because I had a feeling I needed to leave the hospital since they were targeted so heavily. 

All hospitals are being bombed by the regime every time they attack the city, so it's normal to be scared of going to the hospital. Every time a hospital gets targeted and the medical staff move to another hospital, they get targeted again shortly after. We think the Regime must know their movements. 

When I was in the hospital, some of my friends visited me and told me that my friend Mustafa was injured and in the hospital too. But I couldn't get up to see him. 

A week later, my brother Ahmed found my phone under the rubble. When I opened it, I found a picture that one of my friends sent me of Mustafa in hospital. Mustafa was covered in blood, lying on the floor in the hallway. You couldn't distinguish between his blood and his red jacket. 

I can't describe the feeling I had when I saw his picture. I couldn't be with him in his last moments. I couldn't say farewell to my friend Mustafa. He died on the floor of a hospital, lying there between dozens of other injured people covered in blood. I don't know why I have this image of him is stuck in my head.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1214997098592301/?type=3,2016-11-26 06:42:29,955,79,786,285,5,2,0,564,99

""I experienced the most difficult situation of my life last night.  We received a 4 year old girl who was suffocating because she inhaled dust from the constant bombs that rain down on our city. Because of the overcrowding of patients in our hospital, by the time that it took me to go to the next room to get her oxygen and return, the baby girl was dead.

I can still hear the screams of her father. His screams filled the hospital as he was mourning the loss of his baby girl. 

Besides trying to save the lives of our patients, the most difficult task assigned to the the medical staff is delivering bad news to family members who have lost their beloveds.  

You leave the operating room and face families waiting to hear good news, and you are the one who has to give them the worst news that anyone could possibly hear. 

You become the messenger of death. You are the one telling a father that he has lost two of his daughters because we couldn't rescue them.

You can hear the voices of those mourning getting louder and louder in the hospital. They can't stand the shock.  Some of them lose their minds and start beating themselves, while others try to confirm what they have have heard by asking us over and over again ""Is it true? Answer me. Please tell me that my son didn't die, please.""

They are so traumatized. Many of them blame us, cursing the doctors and every medical staff in sight.

There is not a moment in time when we don't feel the overwhelming guilt of losing precious human life because of a lack of medical supplies, equipment and time.  The guilt follows us every second of the day, along with with the voice of each person that has accused us of killing their beloved.

Sometimes,I just stand helpless in front of my patients. I can't give them basic necessities like heating, food, clean sheets or blankets or even painkillers. And when my shifts comes, I visit my patients with nothing to console them with. They lay there, waiting for surgery, suffering from pain, hunger and cold, and I suffer along with them.

Everyone here is devastated psychologically and physically.  We lost hope in everyone and everything. We would prefer if we all just died together, at the same time, with one big bomb. We die every moment that we face the death of our patients knowing that we can't do anything to stop it. 

If i got injured I wouldn't want anyone to help me or treat me, because being injured in this desperate situation is the worst thing that could happen to anyone.""

Baraa is a 23-year-old nurse in Eastern Aleppo. She writes to you about what life is like in a city where hospital workers and staff are regularly targeted and medical supplies are running out.

""I did not study nursing. I was a student of Biomedical engineering but I had to cut my studies short because of the war. It was my dream to study medicine, and ironically that  dream came  true while my other dreams vanished because of the war.

It's really hard to be a nurse in Eastern Aleppo. It just got much harder because all of the hospitals and medical points have been bombed out of service.

We've had to move our operations and patients to homes. We prepare the homes the best way we can so that we can receive as many patients as possible. But there are never enough medical supplies, especially sterilization tools and painkillers.  We can't offer our patients the most basic medical care. 

We can't even give our patients clean blankets. They are forced to use blankets filled with the blood of other patients. They don't have a choice. The cleaning lady can't find the time to wash or dry the blood-stained blankets. Patients die smelling their own blood. They die because of the lack of sterilisation and cold. 

We are constantly receiving huge influxes of civilians injured due to the shelling and bombing, which puts us under extreme and constant pressure to address all of their needs at once.

Many errors have been made because we are overloaded with patients and have a  shortage of medical staff.There are situations where we have patients die while waiting on a major surgery because our doctors are so busy attending to dozens of other patients who are also in desperate need of medical care. We lose patients that could've been saved if we had seconds to spare. 

One of the critical care nurses named Keffah was killed the day before yesterday.  With the death of every doctor or nurse we die more and more.

And there is no time to rest or eat.  Not even for a minute. Doctors and nurses eat while working. Even if we did find the time to sleep, we can't stop thinking of the people that are dying while we are resting.

The pictures or quotes that you see in the media can't even begin to convey the intense fatigue and feeling of helplessness we are facing in this city. This tragic situation has stopped me from having a life. I'm not married. I have no time to study or for personal activities. I no longer have the time to even check on my mother.  The only time that I can see her is when I'm supposed to be sleeping.

I haven't sat down one since yesterday at 6am till 6pm this evening. But I will continue my work so that everyone knows we did our best to save people from this tragic situation we are in. Even if they destroy every single hospital in Eastern Aleppo, I will never give up. We will continue working to help the injured and sick. If our hospital gets bombed, we will move to the next hospital and continue our work.

Even if it ultimately cost me my life, I have nothing left to lose.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1211830242242320/?type=3,2016-11-23 11:40:42,1421,138,1349,536,114,4,0,729,38

The children of Aleppo don't go to school anymore, everything has been destroyed, and even if there a school still exists, it's too dangerous for children to attend.

The children of Aleppo will die eventually, either from the cold, lack of food or medicine. They will die because they don't have milk or even a piece of bread.

Assad and the Russians bombs do not differentiate between a stone or a human. I can't protect my children from the bombs. If a day passes without losing one of them,  it is a miracle to me.

When you see a hungry child walking barefoot, then you know he is from Aleppo. When you see a child crying for his mother or father, lost under the rubble, then you know he is living under siege in Aleppo. When you see a child bleeding to death, tears filling his or her eyes, then you know it is a child from Aleppo. 

My message to all mothers in the world is, learn and teach others how to keep your children safe, not hungry.

Hadi  has been the most prominent Syrian journalist reporting from inside Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and across the country. Hadi, 29, is from Homs, where he started reporting from inside the brutal siege on his hometown of al-Qusair before it was taken by regime and Hezbollah forces in mid-2013.

Two years later, while reporting in Aleppo, his second cameraman Khaled al-Issa was killed in an assassination attempt that had targeted Hadi himself.

Right now Russia is the country primarily responsible for the ongoing killing in Syria that is driving so many people out of their homes and causing unimaginable human suffering. 

A year ago Russia decided to send in its warplanes to prop up Bashar al-Assad's fragile dictatorship. Since then Russia has used illegal weapons on civilians, including incendiary bombs and cluster bombs. It's also giving political cover to Assad's continued use of chemical weapons by blocking any international attempts to stop him.

275,000 people are trapped in besieged east Aleppo today and like so many other Syrian towns, they are being slowly starved and bombed into submission. Russia has ruled out returning to the diplomatic talks that could secure a peaceful transition to a new government in Syria. Instead they are expected to launch a final assault towards this promised ""annihilation"".  Until Aleppo is ""cleansed"".
 
Putin plans to make a final push for ""victory"" while the world is distracted with the US election.

Why the limbs? 

Every single day thousands of photos and videos are uploaded from Syria showing the aftermath of Russian and Assad regime aerial attacks.

One story that I will never forget came from Rady, a young volunteer rescue worker from Idlib. After a Russian airstrike he rushed to the scene where him and his teammates found a man whose wife, daughter and newborn baby had been killed in an airstrike. 

After burying his wife and daughter, the man returned to the scene begging the rescue workers to dig to retrieve some part of his baby. He wanted something to hold onto. Something to bury. 

Such is the utter brutality of Russia's actions that ordinary Syrians, just like you or I, are left searching for the limbs of their loved ones. 

Why Civil Disobedience?

I've sat in the UN while Russia lies about their actions seemingly without consequences. I've sat in meetings with multiple governments who could stop these bombs today to be told with a shrug ""we know, we're sorry it's awful"". I've sat in rooms with international NGOs who lament that if this were an earthquake, a natural disaster, we could get more people to care.

But here's the thing - we do care. There are millions of us around the world who see no difference between us and the Syrians being attacked in their homes. When we see the ongoing war crimes we are outraged not just at Russia and the Assad regime, but at the phoney impotence of our own leaders.

607756062649744_1184100428348635,"For years to come, the little town of Haas will remember the tragedy that befell its students and teachers on the morning of Wednesday the 26th of October. Between anguished sobs, Mr Abdullah, a teacher present during the attacks, told us his story.

""The day of the airstrikes and the massacre, we've called it black Wednesday now, started as a normal school day. There was full attendance. The morning began as usual with the hum of a reconnaissance plane in the background. It came over our area a few times and  there were airstrikes in nearby towns. We weren't too worried though. Our town hasn't been attacked in a very long time and we couldn't imagine that Assad's cruelty would extend to targeting a school.

We finished the first lesson, the second lesson, and recess. During the third lesson, around 10 AM, a plane dropped the first missile and there was a huge explosion about 500 metres east of the school complex. There was fear and panic on our students' faces.

The school administration and the teachers were in a huge dilemma. What do we do? Do we send the children home or are they more likely to be hit in the street? Do we keep them inside the school, a place we had always thought to be safe, and would that save their lives?

The second missile hit the primary school directly. Students there were injured and killed. We were in a state of panic. There was so much screaming and crying. It's a scene I can't describe in words. 

I teach at the boys' school and the students all went out the door. There wasn't time for myself or the principle to make a decision to evacuate. In their panic, the students opened the doors and ran outside themselves.

The third missile fell on the girls' school. The destruction was immense. There were so many dead among the girls and so many injured. Right now we are still getting news of girls and women dying of their injuries. One of the pictures everyone is sharing is a photo of the arm a child holding on to a school bag. Her father now has no part of her to hold onto but that school bag.

The plane was circling above us the whole time and the attacks carried on for about half an hour. There were eight airstrikes in total and it was obvious they were targeting the schools. We found out after that it was two planes doing the bombing. There were a few minutes, maybe even less, between each attack. I can't describe it. I can't understand the brutality that Bashar Al-Assad has reached. 

It was total chaos. The children filled the streets, scared and crying. Many of the town's people showed up to the scene along with our heroic doctors and the civil defence. 

You could fill novels with all the shocking details of that day. Whose story should I tell you? I could tell you about my student Ahmad who wanted to be a brain doctor. He was hit by shrapnel on his way out from the school and killed. He was in pieces.

A total of 43 people died, schoolchildren and teachers. The destruction in the area looks as if we were hit by a tremendous earthquake. Now education is out of service in our town. Our school buildings and our classrooms were utterly destroyed. And there is such fear among the students. It'll be impossible for them to come back.

The town's residents are in a complete state of emotional breakdown. There's hardly a home in town that doesn't have a daughter or son that was injured or killed at the school. In my class alone, I lost two students. My own children were in the complex but thankfully they were unharmed. ""

The day of the massacre, loudspeakers announced that parents whose children hadn't come home from school should come pick up their bodies at the mosque. No parent or child anywhere should have to go through this. 

Make sure everyone knows the story of the schoolchildren in Haas -- share their teacher's story now.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1184100428348635/?type=3,2016-10-28 08:22:36,1366,118,1360,327,2,2,0,794,241

Anyone that cares about democracy, human rights or peace should read this. Share it. Repeat it.

---

We the undersigned are democratic and secular Syrian writers, artists, and journalists who have opposed the tyrannical Assad regime for years, even decades. We are participants in the struggle for democracy and justice in our country, our region and in the world. We unreservedly, and in the strongest language, condemn the Russian and US approach of intervening in our internal Syrian affairs. At least since 2013, these two powers have been working to co-opt the Syrian liberation struggle under the rubric of the ""war against terror."" This is a war that has failed to score a single success since its outset, and has led instead to the destruction of a number of countries.

Three years ago the two imperialist nations signed a reprehensible deal on chemical weapons that resolved a problem for the United States, Israel, and Russia, and even for the Assad regime, which had just murdered 1,466 of its subjects. The deal however did not resolve any of the problems facing the Syrian people. Rather it gave free rein to an extremely criminal regime that kills Syrians, destroys their villages and communities, and drives them into exile. The deal has also proved to be a priceless gift to Islamist nihilistic groups like Daesh and Jabhat an-Nusra. Three years into this contemptible deal—with the death count now at around half a million Syrians—Russians and Americans have agreed to freeze the current situation so that the two military powers can carry on their endless war against terror. The agreement remains silent on the untold number of detainees held in brutal conditions, and includes no call for lifting the blockade on besieged areas, or the withdrawal of Iran, the Hezbollah militia, or any other sectarian militia. It is also devoid of any reference to the concept of a new and democratic Syria. Nor are the warplanes of Bashar al-Assad restrained from bombing areas that will ultimately be the subject of a later agreement between Russia and the United States. Not only does this show complete lack of a moral sense of justice on the part of the Russian and American negotiating teams, it also exposes the degradation of politics and the lowly level of officials in the two most powerful nations in the world today.

Our feelings of anger over these agreements and their authors know no bounds. And we reject them absolutely. We are also disappointed in the United Nations, angered that, as was recently revealed, it has been financing the criminal oligarchy of Assad and his cronies throughout their war against the Syrians.

As Syrian writers, artists, and journalists, we see the world today heading toward an unprecedented numbing of ethics. Levels of fear and hatred escalate in parallel with the increasing visibility of politicians who invest in the same feelings of fear, hatred, and isolationism. We see democracy in retreat around the world, while surveillance, control, and fear are rife and advancing. We do not believe that our fate is defined by these conditions, but rather that these are a result of dangerous choices taken by dangerous political elites, and that we must work together to voice our opposition to them, right now and wherever we may be.

A destroyed Syria is the symbol of the state of the world today. The Syrian revolution was broken against the solid wall of the international community, and not only against the wall of the forces aligned with Assadist fascism. This international community allows politicians like Obama and Putin, along with their agents and clones—people lacking all sense of humanity—to take decisions that violate our right to self-determination, as individuals and groups but also as a nation. We have not elected them, and we have no access to any mechanism that can call them to account. This is an unfair system that fiercely opposes democracy. Therefore it must change.

Unfortunately, there seems to be too little awareness of how hazardous reality has become. Many, especially in the West, prefer to hide behind fatalistic theories steeped in religion or culture—when they do not attribute events to climate change. This explains why a bad situation has become much worse, but it also absolves the powerful elite, including Bashar al-Assad and his gang, of their political responsibilities.

This world must change. In just five and a half years, it has allowed the destruction of one of the most ancient cradles of civilization. The world today is a Syrian problem, just like Syria today is a world problem. And for the sake of this world, for all our sakes, we call for the condemnation of the politicians responsible for this disaster and for their exposure as nihilistic murderers and terrorists, similar to their arch-rivals in the Islamist nihilistic camp.

""At 19:15, Monday, 19/9/2016, a convoy including more than 20 vehicles loaded with food parcels and medical necessities sent by the UN under the supervision of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent came under intensive aerial bombardment by aircraft thought to be Russian and Syrian while they were unloading their contents in the town of Urem Al-Kubra in western Aleppo, killing a number of volunteers, drivers and workers, including Omar Barackat, a Syria Red Crescent official, and wounding many others.
When we arrived at the incident location, the warplanes bombed the UN convoy again with multiple airstrikes, killing and wounding more people; some of them were burned to death before our eyes, while others lost their limbs or were completely dismembered. The final death toll was 15, with 25 wounded; in addition, there was substantial damage to the convoy's aid and medical material.

This is not the first attack of its kind on the personnel of humanitarian organizations in Syria, especially by the Syrian Regime and its allies. We have documented many bombings that directly targeted hospitals, ambulances, aid centres, and Syria Civil Defence centres in the face of an international community that does no more than issue statements of condemnation or concern.

We offer condolences to the Civil Defenders, aid workers, and humanitarian and medical organizations affected, and wish speedy recovery for all those who were wounded. They have seen the grudge on aid workers and the ones who help the Syrian people with their own eyes. This convoy was coordinated by all parties and it was targeted intentionally.

This atrocity must not push international and humanitarian organizations to stop their activities in Syria, as this is exactly what the enemies of humanitarian work wish. Instead, all people must stand in solidarity to face these crimes and refer the perpetrators and their supporters to justice.""",,video,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/videos/1149160775175934/,2016-09-21 03:28:03,570,35,314,219,2,0,1,204,144

""I took this ""selfie"" when the Russians were intensively bombarding my city with napalm bombs two days ago. 

We have seen many incendiary attacks on our cities in Syria. 

The first time the Syrian regime used cluster bombs in Idlib was three years ago.  

The Russian air force also uses cluster bombs but they are a lot stronger than what the regime has been using.

These cluster bombs don't explode in the air only.  They explode when touched by a person. It's as if they are activated by the heat of a human body.

And things got even worse when the Russians started use napalm bombs in Aleppo 6 months ago and in Idlib two months ago. Napalm causes severe damage and serious burns that are nearly impossible to treat, especially when children are the victims.

I'm not a media activist. I'm just a university student who started taking pictures because of a passion for photography and an urge to show people what was happening to my city.

I've never been afraid. I've been injured twice and I'm still taking pictures. Two barrel bombs landed right next to me, 3 shells and rockets, and two days ago, my city was attacked with napalm.

But I'm still here.

 And so long as I'm here, I will continue to  take pictures as a way to to document the crimes committed against the Syrian people and to show the world what we are facing every day.

Manar was a hero who often found himself in every possible dangerous situation you can imagine. He died while bringing water to one of the families in besieged Daraya. A regime sniper shot him. The bullet pierced his chest, hitting his heart.

Before joining the White Helmets, he worked at a water tank, delivering water to families throughout the city. It was a way for him to feed himself and support his family who are displaced in a nearby town.

In his free time, he used to plant seeds next to his house so that he could eat. His field was targeted several times by regime airstrikes but this did not stop him from planting again. He was forced to abandon his field when regime forces took it over along with his source of food.

Whenever or wherever there was a fire because of the napalm attacks or airstrikes in Daraya, you would find Manar working hard and with such bravery. He was known for his courage, good heart and he was loved by the people of Daraya.

We got there and it was like hell. People were running, screaming in the streets and nobody knew what happened - people were trying to use water to treat it but that did nothing.

We went to a field hospital and hundreds of affected people kept coming in. There were so many that doctors could barely check pulses - 'he's dead' - and then they had to move on. Many of those still alive were hallucinating, this is one of the effects of sarin gas. I remember one little girl turning scared to her mother saying, 'Who are you? What do you want?'. I can still see her mother smiling but with fear in her eyes.

I was in shock, crying and shaking too but I was also trained from the front lines and knew I had to help. I spoke to people and took their pictures because even in that chaos, I knew the world needed to see this.

A friend of mine also knew this, that we needed to show this to people, so he brought me to the room of the dead. From the screams of the hospital I went into this quiet room and I couldn't understand, why all these people, all these babies in pyjamas were just lying there sleeping. As a photographer, I see in shots and I started to see more detail, frame by frame in my mind. 

'Why are they silent?' - then the shock, the realization as I saw the dark blue skin, the twisted mouths. I started to shake and cry again and had to leave the room. The chaos of hundreds of people panicking was better than the quiet of the room. I couldn't handle the silence of death, the families dead in pyjamas.

After this, I left and uploaded my photos and tried to come back to help but I was overexposed to the gas and I collapsed. Even from just being near people in the attack, I could hardly breathe and my eyes were swollen and blurry.

I am a photographer, my job is to tell the story and afterwards I had lots of requests for interviews as an eye-witness. What I told them is what I still tell people three years later - this is not 'an event' for you to talk about and then move on. 

After the attack on the 21st, there was a lot of hope in Syria. Obama's 'red line' had been crossed and we thought this meant something would happen, something would change. We waited - for nothing. There have been hundreds of more chemical attacks since, 
people are still losing their families and nothing is being done.

The people of Syria will not be silent about this but world leaders are. If 1,347* can be killed in 2 hours and those with power do nothing, they are not human. They are puppets, toys being moved by others. 

More than a million people in Syria are living under siege today. When these attacks happen to them, they are not an event to talk about and then move on from. Babies have their futures stolen and innocent souls are lost.

The politicians don't give a shit. Yes, they 'remember' but with no action, with no justice, with no freedom or dignity for the people of Syria. Without this, we will carry these memories with no release every day, forever - not just for an 'anniversary'.""

""I live just 300 metres from the attack.  Just after 7PM following the evening prayers we heard the explosions. I rushed there with other three media activists.

The first thing I saw was three bodies on the ground being carried into an ambulance.  Those were the neighbours of Omran's family. The building was totally destroyed -- all six floors were now rubble. 

Then I looked up to see another building half destroyed -- Omran's house. The White Helmet rescue workers climbed the stairs of a building nearby by as the stairs at Omran's house were destroyed. I joined into to help. 

The first survivor they picked up was Omran and I took my camera and started filming. I found it later he was just four year olds.

It was too dark for good footage but I continued and followed him.  The White Helmet carried the boy to the ambulance and laid him on the chair. I kept filming. It is then that I realized how traumatized the boy was and I changed the camera from filming to take a still picture. 

The tears started to drop as I took the photo. Its is not the first time I've cried. I have cried many times while filming traumatized children. I always cry. We war photographers always cry. Last night everyone cried. 

Omran's affected me because he was silent. He didn't cry. He didn't say a word. He was shocked. 

I thought of my 7 days old baby girl. I thought to myself it could be her. It could be any child in Aleppo or Syria. 

Then the White Helmets team continued to rescue the family members. Omar's eldest sister who is 11 looked at me and said please don't film. I turned of my camera and told her ""sure my darling I will not"". 

Thank god all Omran's family are safe. His mother had some bad injuries in her legs. His father suffered a minor head injury. His 7 year old sister went through a surgical operation this afternoon and she is doing well. 

Today when i woke up to see the whole world using the photo and talking about it. I thought to myself, I hope all photos of children and attacks in Syria go viral so the world know what is life like here. 

If people knew what it was like maybe the war will stop the bombing will stop. 

Maybe Omran and my daughter Amal can live normally like all children in the world.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1118057038286308/?type=3,2016-08-18 12:15:46,8321,469,5960,4842,300,10,0,3046,123

Many of us knew Khaled from the 'Miracle Baby' rescue video. Little Mahmoud [pictured] is just on the countless lives Khaled saved. 

Khaled was one of the earliest volunteers of the White Helmets, since joining he has responded to thousands of attacks --- and he made the same choice thousands of times --- to run towards bombs knowing he could be killed. Millions of people around the world have watched the Miracle Baby video and been inspired by Khaled and his bravery. 

Two years ago, Khaled took the first flight of his life to the U.S. where he asked for an end to the the daily massacres -- two years and thousands of attacks later he and his fellow Syrians have still never got an answer. The 'Miracle Baby' video has been screened to dozens of world leaders and to the UN Security Council --- all of whom could have stopped the attacks like the one that killed Khaled if they wanted to.
 
Before the revolution, Khaled was a painter and decorator. Today, like so many others, he died a hero.

Please keep his wife, his two little girls and his fellow volunteers in your thoughts and prayers. 

Humanity lost another hero. We are all heartbroken. 

RIP Khaled.

""We rushed out after the regime warplanes bombed civilian homes. The devastation was enormous, more than five houses were destroyed and there were dozens of dead and wounded. 

After hours of searching under the rubble for life the death toll had reached twenty, but there was still many people missing, including a woman and a child.

We kept searching for another 24 hours until we found everyone but the two month year old baby. 

 At the very moment that we lost hope that we would ever find the baby, his father found us. 

He had just buried his wife and daughter. 

He spoke to us with a broken heart.

"" God bless you and all of your family. 

Please, can you keep searching for my baby, even if you find just a small piece of his body, any piece, I want to bury him near his mother and sister.""

At that very moment I did not realize what was happening to me or around me. It could have been because of the scale of the disaster and the large numbers of dead and wounded. Perhaps it was because of the nature of our work and the days we spend enduring such difficulties and fatigue. But I still have no explanation for what I felt when this father made that tragic request. 

When I get back home late at night I remember the situation. I imagine the baby boy's father in front of me. And I can't control myself, my tears fall down and I start to cry. I cry for myself, and for the father who lost all of his family. 

He survived on the hope of finding even a small piece of his baby boy's body.""

""I only sleep for three to four hours a day because of the pressure of my work. Most of the members of the civil defense work  for 24 hours continuously, and rest for 48 hours before their next shift.

When the civil defense was created we had almost 40 volunteers. Today our number has exceeded  400 volunteers.

I've lost 37 people in my life, including members of my team, relatives and friends. They were killed by sniper, shell or missile. It is hard losing people but I remind myself that we do this because we believe that we have a humanitarian duty towards our fellow Syrians.

I myself have been injured several times, one time was nearly fatal. But I promised myself that I would complete this mission no matter what came my way.

One of the hardest situations I've faced was the chemical attack on Eastern Ghouta in August 2013. We mobilized our staff for a full 72 hours. Our job was to rescue civilians and evacuate them and the dead to our base in Douma.

 I still remember that day, Every time we entered houses we saw families affected by poison from the attack. 

It was really painful seeing infants children and babies who died in such a tragic way.

That day, I went back to my house, I held my two children and cried.  I can't imagine losing them. Every time I save a child, it's as am saving my own children.  Every time we lose a child, it's as if we lost our own children. It's hard to keep focus on your mission and not be emotional, we are humans.

On top of that,  we are facing a lot of difficulties due to the siege on Eastern Ghouta.

We've lost equipment including ambulances, fire trucks and heavy equipment many times. We lost one to two vehicles in every civil defense base due to the attacks that targets civil defense teams as soon as they enter the scene and try to rescue people.

And we can't find the equipment and maintenance we need or get them delivered from abroad. Most of the time we can't even afford to maintain the equipment because of the siege.  We use the machines we have even if they don't function very well.  

When we do find what we need, the prices are very high. But we have no other choice but to buy them. We need them to save people's lives. This is our duty.

With every life we save, we forget all the difficulties that come our way.

However, due to indiscriminate regime airstrikes, people had to wait for days for the aid to be distributed. It was simply too dangerous for them to gather in one place. 

As the local council of Daraya described it, 'Pound-for-pound, the amount of explosives dropped on the city far exceeds that of humanitarian aid delivered.'

This is what one woman in Daraya had to say. 

""On June 9, aid finally came into Daraya after four years of living under siege.

On June 10, regime barrel bombs were raining down on our heads.

Aid entered after four years of siege. My husband was one of the volunteers helping load the aid into the warehouses. The aid is not enough to meet the needs of civilians. It was only enough for 2,500 civilians.  There are 8,000 of us.

Yesterday and today the warehouses storing the aid were targeted. And that's in addition to the indiscriminate, incessant, regime shelling they're carrying out deliberately to make it impossible to distribute the aid to civilians.
 
That the UN has been distributing that paper which is supposed to say what aid they've brought in. We still haven't been able to do an inventory to check how much the regime took from it.

But because the aid isn't enough for all civilians, we've decided to re-distribute the food baskets so that every family has something. We hope there's enough so that each family gets half a food basket.

607756062649744_1069918539766825,"The UN has done so much good in the world. But its aid operation in Syria has gone very, very wrong. 

Today we release a new report ""Taking Sides: How the UN lost impartiality, independence and neutrality in Syria"".

After speaking to more than 50 humanitarians, including senior former and current UN staff, this report details how we arrived at the situation we're at today, where the distribution of billions of dollars of aid gets largely dictated by the Assad regime, where hundreds have died of starvation only minutes away from UN warehouses full of aid.

The aid system in Syria is utterly broken and civilians are paying the price.

What is needed is not international pressure to get one or two trucks into an area besieged for years, but a fundamental reset of how aid works.

There are more than 55 Syrian groups backing the report's recommendations and more are joining every day. They include the Syria Civil Defence (the White Helmets), the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the Violations Documentation Center and many more.

These groups together with The Syria Campaign are calling on the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon to take control by setting clear conditions on the UN's relationship with the Syrian government. This must include the ability to deliver aid impartially to those who need it most, regardless of what side they're on. If this fails, the UN must suspend cooperation with the Syrian government.

Some inside the UN fear that if they take a tougher stance with the Syrian government they'll get their visas withdrawn and they'll be kicked out the country. This isn't true. As David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee says, ""the Assad regime can't afford to kick the UN out of Damascus. The UN is feeding so many of [Assad's] own people.""

A stronger UN in Syria will mean millions more civilians get the food and medicine they need.

This morning, a regime airstrike hit the street outside the Children's Hospital that Dr. Hatem runs in Aleppo, supported by Independent Doctors Association.

Nine premature and newborn babies were at the hospital. The priority was to get the babies downstairs so that they would not suffer the dire consequences of breathing in all the dust.

''It was a horrible moment. The nurses were trampling each other to rush the babies to the basement, while many of them started to cry. As my staff moved the incubators, I went to tell the people in the waiting room to leave the hospital. I ordered them to ""Leave now! There might be a second attack.''

One of the worst fears that immediately follows a strike is the possibility of another.

The hospital is now out of service, like so many other hospitals inside Aleppo today.

All of the babies thankfully survived.

And Dr. Hatem refuses to give up hope.

https://act.thesyriacampaign.org/sign/protect-marea/

"" When I spoke to my fellow doctor Dr Abdel Rahman last night, he said that Isis fighters had reached his hospital's car park. They wanted to take the medical staff as hostages.

The Free Hospital in the northern town of Marea has two specialisms -- one is a surgical facility and the other for women and children. For years its 36 medical staff have worked to provide healthcare for the 12,000 civilians left in the town -- over half are women and children.

When I visited the hospital last year, the situation was critical. I contacted US Ambassador Samantha Power and told her that Isis were only a few kilometers away.

Now the hospital could be overrun any minute. Please send an urgent message to Ambassador Power and the US administration to protect this hospital, now.

https://act.thesyriacampaign.org/sign/protect-marea/

The town of Mareaa in northern Syria is being attacked on all sides. By Isis, by the Assad regime and also by Kurdish forces. Isis hate this town particularly because it represents a non-jihadist view of Syria. The people in Marea detest extremism and there are no extremists there. They want to be free of the Assad regime and groups like Isis.

The US and others have done nothing so far to protect this town. The messages I get over Whatsapp from the head doctor Dr Abdel Rahman are heartbreaking. If the world cannot protect his hospital and patients from Isis then nobody knows what will happen.

Ambassador Power has long championed the voices of Syria's medics, now is the time to really prove it. This week we saw published photos of US soldiers on the ground in Syria fighting Isis. But why have they turned their back on Marea? Why are they indifferent to this hospital on the front line?

Abu Haitham was not just a survivor of this siege but was selfless, always thinking of others. He would give what little milk he could get from his three goats to those most in need. He gave priority to the injured over his own grandchildren. And like so many of the other residents of our town, his family survived on only one meal a day provided by a charity kitchen. Yet Abu Haitham would still find the energy to go collect grass in the nearby fields.

Abu Haitham and his son Saleh left around 8am in the morning and waited all day. But the promised aid never came. And around 4pm Abu Haitham and Saleh gave up and left to take care of their goats.
 
But then the mortar struck. The Assad regime fired mortars on the town after refusing to let the aid in. Abu Haitham and Saleh lost their lives to senseless violence. They lost their lives after learning to cope with the conditions of a brutal siege that has left us inching closer to starvation every day. 

Abu Haitham left behind his wife, a daughter in law and his grandchildren. They have no support now and like so many of us, have all given up on the international community and the idea of help.

""We would have never talked about it just a month ago."" - Staffan De Mistura, UN Syria envoy on the airdrops announcement yesterday.

A month ago together we started pushing the International Syria Support Group (the US, Russia and others supposedly helping to stop the violence) saying they should conduct airdrops of aid to besieged areas if the Assad regime continues to block land access.

Many said it would never happen.

- The UN said publicly they couldn't do it
- Key countries said publicly they wouldn't do it
- Other organisations said it'd be impossible

But together we dug in.

- We published appeals from the women of Daraya and the Daraya Local Council
- We sent 13,000+ emails to key countries on the ISSG
- Many jumped on the phone and called these country missions in NY and Geneva
- We organised a public letter from more than 25 key European politicians
- We pushed calls from Syrians out to the media far and wide
-  Women Now for Development spoke to the press and broke the stories of women living under siege
- An open letter from women at the Women Now centre in Daraya mobilised protests across Syria and received solidarity from parliamentarians and women in Europe who raised their voice in support of their demands
- Friends from Syria Solidarity UK organised protests and statements from activists in support of airdrops
- and much more besides..

Well yesterday the ISSG called for it. If Assad doesn't open the road by 1st of June, they are calling on the UN to set up an air bridge to all besieged areas.

Ahmad from Daraya said ""We can't judge or celebrate until we see the aid with our own eyes. We were hopeful during these last two months of peace but now we're being shelled again. Our wheat harvests are being burned. The regime is trying to make the siege even more difficult.""

That's why this is only a first step. We need to make sure the UN don't ask for permission they'll never get. We need to make sure countries who are part of the ISSG use all means to get this aid in.

And we need to make sure that this is movement towards ensuring sustained access to all areas across Syria. Airdrops are a sticking plaster, they're not a solution to the problem. No civilians should be going hungry because their government is blocking aid.

There is so much bleak news on Syria, and so much of it eclipses this little bit of good news. But let's celebrate this important win and use it to energise us. 

If this is possible then we must work together to achieve much, much more.

We have seen the hint of a backbone from the international community that everyone assumed had disappeared. We must keep pushing to break the sieges, stop the barrel bombs and unlock the dungeons holding so many political prisoners.

Well done everyone. Onwards.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/1050356531723026/?type=3,2016-05-18 02:45:37,1658,47,946,1503,139,4,0,10,2

Yesterday: A father and son were killed by Regime shelling whilst standing waiting for an aid convoy --- they had not seen an aid delivery for 1301 days. 

Here's the story of the day's failures: 

Yesterday, the UN FINALLY drove aid trucks to Daraya -- a besieged town just 20 mins drive from UN HQ.  Unbelievably the convoy contained NO food -- just some medicines as that was all the Regime allowed. Once the UN reached the town the Regime removed all the medicine. The UN was stuck at the checkpoint calling Russia to ask them to call the Syrian Regime to let them in as they had agreed. This phone tag happened in the middle of the biggest operation in the UN's history. 

Hours later, people in the town were informed that the convoy had been denied entry and would turn back. 

Civilians were gathered at the entrance to the town since morning, waiting for the aid trucks to enter. While some went home later in the day upset at the wait and the lack of food on the convoy, others remained. As soon as the convoy left they became the targets of the Syrian regime's shelling -- A father and son were killed and five others injured. 

The father and son should never have been standing for hours waiting for food. With the denial of access today and the shelling of those gathered at the collection point, it is clear that the UN and its donors' failures have put malnourished people in the firing line. Today is a dark day in the history of the UN and the world.

I am Dr Hatem, the director of the Children's Hospital in Aleppo. 

Last night, 27 staff and patients were killed in an airstrike on Al Quds Hospital nearby. My friend Dr Muhammad Waseem Maaz (pictured), the city's most qualified paediatrician, was killed in the attack. 

He used to work at our Children's Hospital during the day and then he'd go to Al Quds Hospital to attend to emergencies overnight. 

Dr Maaz and I used to spend six hours a day together. He was friendly, kind and he used to joke a lot with the whole staff. He was the loveliest doctor in our hospital.

I'm in Turkey now, and he was supposed to visit his family here after I returned to Aleppo. He hadn't seen them in four months.

Dr Maaz stayed in Aleppo, the most dangerous city in the world, because of his devotion to his patients. Hospitals are often targeted by government and Russian air forces. 

Days before Dr Maaz's life was taken, an airstrike hit only 200 metres away from our hospital. When the bombing intensifies, the medical staff run down to the ground floor of the hospital carrying the babies' incubators in order to protect them.

Like so many others, Dr Maaz was killed for saving lives. Today we remember Dr Maaz's humanity and his bravery. Please share his story so others may know what medics in Aleppo and across Syria are facing. 

The situation today is critical - Aleppo may soon come under siege. We need the world to be watching.

We are asking for aid to be sent to the town immediately, and if it can't be driven there, then it must be airdropped from the sky.

I know what it's like to experience hunger. 

I lived under siege in Eastern Ghouta in Damascus for two and a half years. Still, compared to Daraya now, our situation was a blessing. We were able to grow some vegetables to survive. We would grind animal feed and mix it with water to make 'bread'.  

But in Daraya they don't have anything. 

I last spoke to people in Daraya two days ago to see what their needs were. The men listed the usual items like protein-rich food, and medicine and vaccines. 

But the needs of the women were very specific and detailed. 

Their daily struggles are different. They don't have sanitary pads. They use cloths instead but then there's no clean water to sanitise the cloths afterwards. They need lice shampoo and soap. They need milk and milk bottles to be sent in for their babies. They can't breastfeed because they're malnourished.  

I'm seven months pregnant now and I think about the women and kids in Daraya constantly. 

The woman who runs our network's centre in Daraya has had two miscarriages during the siege due to malnutrition and lack of medical care. One was at three months and the other one was at six months. 

We can do something. I don't want us a few weeks from now to be crying over images of people who have starved to death and say ""I wish we had done something before"". The time is now. Please call on world governments to airdrop food into Daraya today:

""Dear friends,

I am writing to you from the besieged town of Daraya.

They call our town the school of the peaceful uprising. But right now our people are beginning to starve and some are resorting to eating grass to survive. We have been under brutal siege by Assad's regime for over three years.

Yesterday the UN announced that it has the regime's permission to deliver aid to besieged areas, but Daraya was not on the list. We have not received any aid for over 1,000 days.

We were promised a month ago by the United States and the UN that it would only be a matter of days before convoys of food and medicine would enter. But still there has been nothing.

We are being punished for daring to rise up peacefully for our freedom and dignity. There are no extremists like Isis here, or Nusra. Those defending our neighbourhoods are all locals, protecting the streets from a government that has tortured, gassed and bombed us and our families.

What scares the regime is the strength and legitimacy of our community. Our democratically-elected council is a threat to Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship.

We respect all international agreements that have been made on Syria. But we cannot enforce them. That is why we are calling on you, friends around the world, to push the UN, United States and other key countries to uphold these agreements and deliver food and medicine to our town immediately.

Please send a message to key negotiators on humanitarian aid, demanding they keep their promises and break the siege on Daraya

The Russians have been bombing the hell out of Aleppo for over a month, they are on their way to decimating the opposition and shoring up Assad - why would they stop now? 

Only a paltry amount of aid has reached the besieged areas that need it most while Russian and Syrian forces are still trying to regain as much territory as they can. But for the first time in years, bombs have stopped raining on civilian communities. People are able to walk in the streets without barrel bombs, shells or shrapnel falling on them.

Next week, it will be five years since the Syrian peaceful uprising began. This all started when ordinary folk went out and held up banners asking for reforms, freedom, justice and democracy. When Assad turned his forces on the opposition, Syria descended into chaos. Out of the instability, extremist groups were able to proliferate. 

For far too long, Syria has just been known in international news headlines for ISIS and the refugee crisis. And because of the complexity of this war, civilian voices were silenced and the nonviolent struggle mostly dismissed as nonexistent. 

This past week, you would think that Syrians would have taken advantage of the relative peace and quiet to recuperate, to run errands or even to try escaping their besieged hometowns and seeking better lives elsewhere. 

Syrians have been subjected to five years of unrelenting punishing violence, the kind of violence that can irrevocably break a people. Surely, the world thought they must have given up on their yearning for basic human rights by now. 

But, instead, civilians burst out into the streets of Syria in droves reigniting the original peaceful uprising with such renewed vigor and such an unexpected joie de vivre! Exiled Syrians watching from abroad, in utter disbelief, are tearing up at the mere sight of their country men and women resuming a cherished revolution with the elated chanting, the joyful communal dancing and the taunting slogans addressed to Assad and his clique.

More importantly, we're back to the unwavering faith that what Syrians took incommensurable risks to ignite isn't over just yet.

We Syrians need your prayers and support more than ever. We are not doomed to enter the annals of a tragic history. In a hundred years, people will look back on this era and they will say that we have achieved the impossible.

Many RBSS members have been brutally murdered for daring to show the truth. In fact, one of their leaders was just assassinated in his apartment in Turkey last month. Yet, despite the significant risks, they continue to report on events in the ISIS-held province, from the mundane to the most horrific human rights violations such as beheadings, rape and crucifixions.

These brave young men and women face execution at any time for leaking out images and reports from the tightly controlled northern province that has been under ISIS control for two years. Foreign journalists who don't have access to Raqqa often rely on those reports to find out what daily life in Raqqa is like.

RBSS shows the complexities of life in Raqqa: many citizens have reluctantly joined ISIS because they are often not given any other choice. RBSS chose to stand strong and resist the slow creep of ISIS by exposing their flagrant abuses at every turn.

We've seen too many civilians and medical staff die in our hospital to count. The hardest part is knowing that these attacks will happen again - the UN and international community needs to enforce their own resolutions and commitments to upholding international law, and prevent more attacks against hospitals.""

Syrian Network for Human Rights - الشبكة السورية لحقوق الإنسان, who reported more than 150 were injured. 

Rebel groups should be strongly condemned for these indiscriminate attacks, especially since it's not the first time that they have killed civilians in government-held areas. As the opposition, they can't claim moral high ground if their behaviour mirrors that of the regime.

Commenting on this attack Haid N. Haid, a Syrian activist at Planet Syria - كوكب سوريا wrote:

""Indiscriminate shelling by all sides should stop, especially by opposition groups which are supposed to be trying to create a more moral and humane alternative to the current regime. Most casualties of this shelling are civilians so we should condemn it just as strongly as we condemn indiscriminate attacks by the regime, while still acknowledging the differences between both sides.

The area I've been working in is called Ghouta. It was gassed with sarin by the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 2013 and the world did nothing. All of us responded to the attack that day and all of us suffered symptoms of chemical poisoning. But we carried on working.

Since then Ghouta has been under siege by the government, nothing is allowed in including medicines, and every day bombs rain from the skies. We have six field hospitals in Ghouta - one of them has an emergency room, one a surgery, one does blood analysis, another blood dialysis. All of them are underground to protect from bombing, but we have to transport patients between them overground. We have no ambulances under siege so we use a van with a bed in the back.

Medical workers have been systematically targeted by the Syrian regime and I have lost many friends and colleagues. They are killed because they are saving lives.

I am in Germany now because I need to finish my studies. I want to be a qualified surgeon so I can go back and help my people. Everyone here in this camp in Germany wants to go back. We appreciate the welcome and support of so many here in Europe but Syria is our home.

We believe that these refugees are the best people to answer that question and we are working on a campaign to elevate their demands. Ahead of that we wanted to share some thoughts based on our experiences. In Syria, we have heard it time and time again, and unequivocally. To end the conflict, to defeat Isis, and to return to their homes, Syrians are calling for a no-fly zone.

Since the picture of Aylan hit headlines across the world 6 children have been killed in Syria every day, the majority from barrel bombs and missiles from Syrian government aircraft. But their bloodied and blown apart corpses don't make the front page of any newspaper. None of the other 10,000 children killed in the fighting have.

The war in Syria has killed more than 300,000 people and displaced 12 million, forcing more than four million to flee the country -- the UN has called it ""the greatest humanitarian crisis of our era."" But what happening in Syria is also a crisis of politics and humanity. Syria is not an earthquake or a natural disaster; these crimes have agents and perpetrators, none of which is greater than the Syrian government, which is responsible for over 85% of civilian deaths.

Since 2012 the Syrian Government has waged an aerial war on Syrian civilians as a form of collective punishment for daring to ask for the freedom and democracy that people in Europe and America enjoy. As the UN has said, most of the killing of civilians today comes from the regime's ""indiscriminate aerial weapons"", the leading one is the barrel bomb.They kill civilians and shatter communities who want no part in the violence. The fear of these bombs drives mass displacement -- 500,000 people fled Aleppo as a result of the aerial campaign in four months alone. Aylan's family fled Aleppo due to the aerial attacks. 

Every barrel bomb dropped deepens the cycle of violence and extremism. Left unchecked these barrel bombs will continue to strengthen ISIS, continue to attract more foreign fighters to Syria and that crisis too will explode onto mainland Europe with more terror attacks.  

In February 2014, the UN Security Council [in a rare moment of consensus] banned the use of barrel bombs but since then the attacks have only increased. The Syrian government has repeatedly ignored UN resolutions, and the strong words and hand wringing from the international community has done nothing to stop the killing. 

The international community can end these attacks. A Bosnia style no-fly zone could be put in place to stop the Syrian government's airforce from bombing its own people. A no-fly zone does not need to be a major military undertaking. The 67+ country US-led anti-Isis coalition is already flying in areas where the barrel bombs are being dropped.

Syrians don't want to be resettled in distant lands or rely on ever-dwindling aid packages. They want what everyone wants – to live in their own homes in safety and with dignity. A no-fly zone would stop more people fleeing, allow millions to return home and help civil society flourish. Furthermore it would help create the conditions for real, internationally-backed talks.

The answer is clear for how best to support Syrian refugees. We must all call on our governments to support a no-fly zone.

""The ultimate injustice one can commit to Aylan Kurdi and his family is to omit the parts of his story which explain why he ended up dead on the beach. The details matter, so please read and share:

1) Abdullah Kurdi, the father, was detained for 5 months in Air Force Intelligence in Damascus. While in detention, he was tortured and his teeth were pulled out. He had to sell his shop in Damascus in order to bribe the officers to let him out. This cost him 5,000,000 Syrian Liras (around $25,000)

2) After he bribed his way out of jail, Abdullah fled to Aleppo with his wife and sons, Aylan and Ghalib. The situation in Aleppo became dangerous due to the constant aerial bombardment, so he fled again to Kobani, his hometown.

3) When ISIS attacked Kobani last year, the family could no longer live in their hometown, so they fled to Turkey. Once in Turkey, the Turkish government did not provide them with assistance, so they paid almost $6,000 to secure 4 spots on a rubber dingy to the Greek island of Kos. 

4) While on the boat, rough waters caused the boat to flip. The lifejackets they were given were fake. His sons and wife all drowned in front of his eyes, in his arms.

5) Abdullah Kurdi and his brother wanted to seek refuge in Canada, where their sister lives. However his brother's application was rejected, so then the families decided to pay a smuggler to take them to Greece by boat. After Aylan's photo became a media story, he was reportedly offered citizenship to Canada. But now he doesn't want to go to Canada or Europe anymore. He says he will go bury his family in Kobani and stay there to fight against ISIS, because everything has been taken away from him and he has ""nothing to live for.""

So if the world wants to see no more Aylans on the beach, someone needs to do some combination of the following based on above: (1) stop torture and arbitrary detention by the Assad regime, (2) stop the regime's aerial bombardment, (3) stop ISIS, (4) make traveling to Europe safe, (5) get Canada and the USA to accept more refugees.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/900440830047931/?type=3,2015-09-05 10:52:20,350,22,324,350,0,0,0,0,0

607756062649744_898719416886739,"""My name is Mohamed and I'm from Dera'a, Syria. My family, friends and neighbours know me as 'Abul Ward,' Arabic for 'father of the roses.' I got this name since I was known for my garden filled with flowers, and because I loved to give everyone a flower that passed by my house.

In early 2011, I had been a fire fighter for the Syrian government for 13 years. When my neighbours' kids were caught, tortured, and thrown into a prison for writing 'anti-government' slogans on the walls of their school, I defected. How could I stand to support a system that supports torturing innocent children? I was the first to leave my team, but soon after, most of my squad defected behind me.

A couple weeks after I defected I was stopped at a checkpoint by the regime. They took me to a state prison for two months. My experiences of torture in a sweltering pitch-black confined room with over 100 people are memories that will scar my past but empower my future. For every moldy piece of bread I was forced to eat, for every kick and punch I got, and for my fellow inmates who didn't make it out alive, I am living my life more fully for it.

From the time I was hung by hands for four days straight, to when my heart stopped for three minutes before I was revived, all the suffering I experienced made me stronger and more resilient. Now I am a White Helmet volunteer. After I left prison, I heard about these men and women who were rescuing people from under the rubble, and were also fighting fire. I knew this was the place for me.

For the past year we have been saving lives and pulling people from under the destruction of their homes and buildings, but we can't save everyone. Destruction, pain and heartbreak can last for a lifetime, but beautiful things may appear in the wake of tragedy. Once, we buried a few young men killed by barrel bombs. We buried the men a day after their murder; when our team and family returned to the gravesite a few weeks later, we were surprised to find no foul stench and the most beautiful flowers growing there. 

When I think about the Syrian struggle, I can't help but think of my favourite flower, the orchid. The orchid is a symbol of the Syrian people, for regardless of what season it is, the flower is able to survive. This flower demonstrates strength, resilience and beauty, just like those Syrians who are still struggling for freedom peacefully despite all the obstacles.

My dream for my beloved Syria is for it not to be covered with barrel bombs, destruction, war and blood, but with flowers, from my city of Dera'a all the way to the north of Syria and the border of Turkey. Every flower will represent our brothers and sisters for their strength, resilience and beautiful memories for reaching a better tomorrow.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/898719416886739/?type=3,2015-09-02 11:22:43,388,30,178,388,0,0,0,0,0

Entire families foamed at the mouth after the dawn attack, shaking in shock, and hundreds died. Little bodies were lined up in rows, the lack of blood making it appear as if they were asleep.

The pictures from Ghouta shocked and angered people all over the world. Bashar al-Assad had joined the only two leaders in 90 years to have used chemical weapons against their own people: Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler. Barack Obama said a red line had been crossed and a threat of force by the US led Assad to agree to destroy his chemical stockpiles.

Fast forward two years later to today, and Syrians are still being gassed. Barrel bombs are being filled with chlorine and dropped onto family homes, turning them into gas chambers.

1 - The Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad is killing at least 7 times more civilians than Isis.

2 - More than 11,000 barrel bombs made of scrap metal and high explosives have been rolled out of regime helicopters onto hospitals, homes and schools since the UN banned them. These aerial attacks are the biggest killer of civilians. They drive extremism.

3 - These barrel bombs are a leading cause of displacement, forcing refugees to cross the Mediterranean and other borders.

4 - Many of the barrel bombs are dropped on areas under siege. More than half a million people in Syria live in areas with no access to food, water or medicine since 2013, including the areas of Ghouta that were targeted by the sarin gas attacks in the same year.

5 - The international anti-Isis coalition is flying in the same airspace where many of these barrel bombs are dropped, choosing to look the other way

There is no military solution to the fighting in Syria. But like in Bosnia, a no-fly zone can help protect civilians from the worst of the violence and encourage the fighting parties to come to the negotiating table.

I moved through rows of injured people, all lying on the ground in a critical condition, and each tried to muster some strength to motion to me with their hands or to whimper, anything that expresses their pain. They wanted to send me the message ' I am wounded and you have been chosen by God to rescue me or else to experience pain from your inability to rescue me.'

As I come to the realization that we have all reached breaking point in that wretched hospital room, a voice came down to us as if from above. We all listen attentively to this voice hoping it will say something to calm us down, the voice starts... ""Guys, empty the Intensive Care Unit.. the warplane has launched a second strike, and a third, and... and a tenth.""

And I begin to see the injuries multiplying, the number of deaths multiplying. And I realize there is no more blood for transfusions, no more sanitized medical equipment and no more serum bags but we continue working as if it's the end of the world.

Even the wounded look at you with the eyes of those who have been condemned to hope, and as soon as you're done with an injured civilian, another looks at you with pleading eyes that are saying ""my fate depends on you."" As I'm heading towards one of the victims, another one lying prostrate on the ground right next to him takes hold of my arm and pleads: ""Doctor I swear I was here before him. I arrived right after the first strike."" And in that moment, I wish I could be shattered into hundreds of pieces so that each piece could treat someone's brother or mother or father.  

Then my colleague, another doctor helping treat the wounded, yells: ""come check out my cousin. I think he died but I can't make a final decision.""

Another one yells: ""Doctor, come see this guy that I tried to revive. I think he's dead.""

Other people stand around and ask: ""that guy breathing from his neck, is there anything we can do to help him?""

""Doctor, is there anything I can help you with?"" I turn around and see an ophthalmologist who came from Ghouta to share my burden and carry out the duty that God has thrust upon him. Same with the pediatrician and same with the neurologist. Because they see all the wounded as family. Syrians are one people.

A few hours have elapsed since the air raid and I now look across the Intensive Care Unit. At least the ground has been emptied of its injured although the beds are still all occupied. I begin to feel that the situation is a bit more manageable now. This is when the rescue operations end and the real catastrophe begins. The Syria Civil Defense teams have documented more than 100 deaths.

100 souls that have left this life

100 families who have lost a member

100 women who have lost a son, a husband or a brother

100 men who have lost a son, a daughter, a husband, a father or a sibling

I move through the operation rooms and see exhausted doctors who have performed more than 70 surgeries during the past few hours. They have seen guts spilled out, amputated legs, dislodged eyes, slashed necks --- their green scrubs are dark from the blood.

As for those who have made it through the chaotic ICU and surgery, they are looking at days or weeks at the hospital while they recover.

607756062649744_889186954506652,"""Three months ago, my beloved 5-year-old son, Yazan, was killed in our home by a barrel bomb. He died in my arms.

That day, I vowed I would never leave Syria. I couldn't save my own son's life, but maybe I could save the lives of other people.

I am a member of the Civil Defense Force in Syria. 

When the helicopter approached my house and started to hover over it, all the neighbors were screaming. My wife grabbed our infant son, Zain, and I picked up Yazan, but we couldn't reach our shelter in time.

One minute, I was holding Yazan in my arms, and the next minute, the bomb exploded.

He was gone.

The pressure of the bomb had catapulted him out of the house, and we found him outside, covered in rubble, dead.

My White Helmet colleagues came to rescue us. They brought him to the hospital, but I knew he was dead because of what he'd said to me just before the bomb hit.

He told me, ""Papa, I am going to be martyred, and I am going to take all of you with me."" Then, he died.

The White Helmets rescued my wife, Asma'a, and Zain out of the rubble.

Yazan was such a clever boy. He never forgot a single thing I told him. He used to say, ""When I get older, Papa, I will be a civil defender, just like you."" He had just started learning the alphabet in kindergarten.

To lose my son was God's will, but it has paralyzed my thoughts. I cannot think too much about it. I guess I am still in shock.

But, ever since it happened, I carry on working. It helps me to do something useful every day. I always tell myself, ""I am not the first person to lose my son, and I will not be the last.""

Our house was close to a military airbase, so it was vulnerable to attack. We civil defense forces are often attacked, and our base has been bombed six times.

Ninety-three White Helmets have died in Syria since we started rescuing people. Most of them were young men with wives and children. I am 32.

We are now living in a temporary space our neighbors found for us while we look for a new home. It is cramped, and we all share one room.

My family has enough to get by for now. We're lucky to have some land, and we grow vegetables.

Not all are as lucky as us. Very little aid comes through this town. A few charities give small amounts to the poorest people or to prisoners, but most people get by with nothing.

Before the revolution, I worked dyeing wool in a government-run weaving factory. I will not return to that job.

I will never leave Syria.

It is my responsibility as a civil defender to stay and help my people. But, we are running out of hope that this destruction will ever end.

The head of the White Helmets went to the UN Security Council and gave all the facts – the bombs that were attacking us, the chlorine attacks — but with all the talk in the international community, we've seen nothing change.

My dream is that people can return to their homes without fear. We don't want to hear any more jet fighters or military aircrafts hovering over our houses.

And my biggest hope for my son, Zain, is that he can grow up in peace, go to college and make something of his life.""

I joined the White Helmets five months ago, and I've saved about 20 people since then.

When I'm pulling people out of the rubble, it feels like I've just given birth or have helped someone give birth to a new child.

It makes me very happy to know I am helping my fellow Syrians through this ugly war, but at the same time, I feel deep sadness after seeing people going through so much pain.

I live in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which is in the Governorate of Idlib. Every day, the government rains down bombs on Khan Sheikhoun.

At least two barrel bombs are dropped each day, and now, a terrifying new type of bomb is being used. We call them navy mines. They contain the same explosives as barrel bombs, but they explode in the air instead of on the ground.

They make a horrifying noise when they explode. It is like an earthquake, and for a few minutes, it feels as if the whole town has been demolished, and everybody has died.

They are designed to make us panic and to terrorize us. It works.

We blast sirens as soon as we hear a plane or a helicopter approaching with the intent to bomb, but we usually don't have enough time to warn people to flee.""

He was a volunteer with a civil defence centre in the region of Eastern Ghouta in Damascus, an area under starvation siege. 

Samir's team heard about a bombing in the town of Saqba. The six rescue workers all wanted to respond. Samir volunteered to go first and explore the attack scene to assess the situation and check for the possibility of a double-tap strike. Unfortunately this is exactly what happened. After Samir arrived, a plane returned to the attack scene to strike. He was killed but saved the lives of his 5 friends.

607756062649744_887303894694958,"Mazen Darwish is a prominent Syrian human rights lawyer and free speech advocate. He was arrested, along with 16 of his colleagues, on February 16th, 2012 during a raid carried out by the intelligence services on the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) which Darwish founded. As soon as Darwish was detained, he was denied access to a lawyer, his family members were not allowed to talk to him and, despite news that he had been brutally tortured, he was not given any medical care.

For a while nothing was known about Mazen's fate. His wife was able to glean some details about where he was being held and how he was being treated from former detainees who had chanced upon him in the Mezzeh Air force detention center, one of the most feared prisons in Syria.

It should be noted that Mazen was no stranger to persecution. In the years leading up to his arrest, he had experienced constant harassment at the hands of security services due to his great work in human rights. Not only was he prohibited from practicing law for life, he was also banned from traveling for four years and had to report to security forces on an almost daily basis.

Despite these considerable difficulties, Mazen Darwish was determined to stay in Syria because he adamantly believed in the ability of human rights activists to triumph against all odds if they carried on their work for dignity and justice in a country lacking both. When the uprising erupted in Syria in 2011, the Syrian government began rounding up all prominent human rights defenders who had been speaking out against human rights violations. Mazen Darwish was sadly one of them. His friends' warnings fell on deaf ears and he chose to remain in Syria because everything he had always hoped for was finally materializing. The fight for justice had arrived to Syria. He often told his wife that it was was his duty to continue, unrelentingly, to report on the human rights abuses that were taking place every day- rampant crimes against humanity, summary executions and savage torture in Syria's hidden detention centers.

Mazen's story is one amongst many. There is a multitude of brave activists currently languishing in prison, countless enforced disappearances and families torn apart by loss after loss. These people are seized from their homes or work places just for speaking out against the government and many of them await military trials for nonexistent crimes.

Mazen was released today after more than three years in prison, ahead of a final verdict in his case on August 21.

Like the Syrian conflict today, Bosnia saw horrific atrocities, unprecedented numbers of refugees and an exorbitant death toll. Terms like ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" became familiar, just as ""barrel bombs"" and ""chlorine gas"" are becoming familiar today. 

In both Syria and Bosnia, we saw state and non-state actors unafraid of using violence against civilians. And we saw calculating elites eager to exploit ethnic and religious differences and foment religious extremism on all sides...The intervention in Bosnia saved lives. It dampened extremism.

I recently addressed the UN Security Council as head of the Syria Civil Defence about what they would do to stop the bombs in Syria. When I asked them what am I supposed to tell my colleagues upon my return, none of the leaders gave me an answer. Most Syrians had warned me before I left to testify, insisting that the world no longer cares about us, that we've become just a series of numbers for them. But two days after the launch of this campaign, I gained new clarity. It's become very clear to me that humanity does not differentiate based on ethnicity or race or colour. You have given a glimmer of hope to all the heroes who work tirelessly to help people on a daily basis.

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving hope to the heroes of the civil defence, for enabling them to carry on with their daily work and sacrifices in their quest to save humanity.""

Ten days later he was taken to a hospital in Kafranbel. A specialist conducted another surgery to fix the nerve. Based on doctors' reports, his teammates are saying that the injury might cause permanent disability in his left hand and loss of sensation.

I lost a limb; my left leg. This is the least of my duties for my family in Jisr Al Shughour. I am determined to continue this work – even with one leg, I do whatever I can. What I fear is witnessing an attack where I won't be able to save a soul from under the rubble.

As a patriotic Syrian, I never imagined I would one day ask for a foreign intervention in my country, by land or air. But the lives of innocent women and children that we see dying in our hands every day compel us to ask for any intervention possible to stop the barbaric killing machine led by Bashar al-Assad, including preventing Syrian aircraft from flying, and especially preventing helicopters from hovering above us and dropping these bombs.""

Instead of embarking on a honeymoon with his new bride, Mohammed resumed his work in the civil defense forces after the celebrations ended. Yesterday, as he was on his way to the town of Jisr al-Shughour in Idlib province with his team, he decided to pick up some groceries at the public market and drop them off at his house. His team members told him they would wait for him at the end of the road. But Mohammed never joined them as promised.

The second he set foot in the market, three thermobaric missiles launched by government forces landed. Thermobaric weapons produce a prolonged pressure pulse that is infinitely more lethal than standard explosives and the internal injuries they can cause are nearly impossible to treat.

Mohammed's team rushed back to the public market to start looking for survivors – a daily routine for them. Mohammed was gravely wounded, but he made it. He is in critical condition and is being treated at a hospital in Antakya. 60 Syrians, however, did not make it that day and 120 more were injured.

They waved flags, locked arms and performed celebratory dances expressing their hope for change in forward-looking songs and leaflets.

Four years later, bleakness permeates news of ISIS advances across Syria. The same civilians who had demonstrated peacefully in Palmyra are now hiding in their basements as they await the next airstrike by the Syrian regime or the next beheading at the hands of ISIS fighters now roaming their streets.

We must not forget the peaceful beginnings of the Syrian people's uprising against injustice. The world stood by and watched as Syrians tried to overcome repression with humorous slogans, jubilant songs and all kinds of creative dissidence.

Regime forces crushed that peaceful movement compelling some Syrians to take up arms. The armed opposition soon splintered into militias headed by warring warlords. Civilians lost hope and the prolonged fighting led to a vacuum that ISIS rushed to fill.

Photographer Bassam Khabieh tells the story of this picture. 

""Whenever the aid convoy entered the Eastern Ghouta, children would gather around it, happy that they were going to be supplied with food and medicine. While I was there, the children asked me to take their pictures so they could see them on the camera's screen. The children gathered around me so I could photograph them. First I took a photo of Ghazal, then her sister Judy who was carrying a baby called Suhair asked me to take a picture of her kissing the baby. While I was taking these photos, a shell landed on the area. The children started to scream and cry amid the dust and blood around them. The shell killed a female volunteer from the Red Crescent. The children were terrified, especially when they saw the female volunteer covered with blood. 

This was the first time I had seen how children's innocent laughter could turn into screams, fear and tears. Seconds before the strike, the children were looking at me happily, getting ready for a picture. It was a very sad moment when I put my eye to the viewfinder to take pictures of laughing children; then when I looked back after taking the picture, I saw the same children crying, distraught.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/TheSyriaCampaign/photos/a.608812989210718.1073741828.607756062649744/843034282455253/?type=3,2015-05-13 17:16:25,148,19,81,148,0,0,0,0,0

""I was studying dentistry, but I stopped during my fourth year in 2012. There was a shortage of doctors in Eastern Ghouta, so I volunteered two and half years ago. 

Then all the roads were closed—the siege had begun.
In the beginning there were no centralized emergency points—just separated groups of medical aid teams who I volunteered with. Over time, a medical office was opened and I volunteered in the emergency department.

After several months, I started volunteering with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) where we divided our work between medical and emergency work, vaccines, psychological support, and school health lessons for children.

The idea of psychological support for children is to try to make them feel happy through a variety of activities within our capabilities and ideas. We sometimes organize entertainment activities for the injured children who have a long road to recovery and get bored and upset. We organize small concerts when they feel up to it to try and make them feel better. I am delighted when I see a smile on their faces; that's when I feel I did my job well and I've made a great achievement.

I divide my time between SARC, the ER in the medical center and dental clinics in addition to some local development activities, like helping to organize courses in international law.

I live on my own in Eastern Ghouta. The first period was really hard. I learned how to cook and do the laundry and all the housekeeping myself. But after a while I got bored and moved to the medical center to live with the other young volunteers who are alone here too. And we became like a family. Everything I own is in my backpack, which I take with me almost everywhere.""

----

I am sorry Mother that the ship sunk and that I couldn't get there and pay off the debts from the journey,

Don't be sad mother that they didn't find my body, for what use could it be to you now, except for the cost of transport, the funeral and burial,

I'm sorry mother that war came to us and I had to leave like the others, although my dreams were not big like theirs,

As you know, all my dreams were the size of a box of medicine for your colon, and the cost of fixing your teeth. On that note, my teeth are now green from the colour of the algae clinging to them,

Despite that, they are still more beautiful than the dictator's teeth,

I am sorry my dear for building you a house of illusions. A wooden cottage like the ones we saw in movies. A humble cottage far away from the barrel bombs, far away from sectarianism, ethnic loyalties and the rumours of our neighbours,

I am sorry brother that I couldn't send you the fifty Euros that I promised you at the beginning of every month so you could have a good time ahead of your graduation,

I am sorry sister that I didn't send you the new mobile phone that has wi-fi like the one your better-off friend has,

I am sorry my beautiful home that I will never hang my coat behind your door,

I am sorry dear divers and search and rescue workers, for I don't know the name of the sea I drowned in,

Rest easy immigration department, for I won't be a heavy burden on you,

Thank you dear sea for welcoming us without a visa or a passport. Thank you to the fish who will share me without asking about my religion or political beliefs,

Thank you to the news channels who will report the news of our deaths for five minutes every hour for two days,

And thank you for grieving us when you hear the news… I'm sorry I drowned.

I look back now and remember the armed men who ran towards us with orders to shoot but could not find the hate inside them to do so and threw down their weapons and joined our lines and chanted 'we are one'

I look back now and remember those that managed to hate us, and made martyrs of us, only we would carry our martyrs on our shoulders with pride, all of us now, standing in the very front row

I look back now and remember a mother who said to me, ""it is our duty to sacrifice my son"" i believed her words were genuine, for the blood on her hands and her son laid still on her lap were pure witness to this

I look back now and remember the solidarity of humans from around the world who stood by us and offered what they could and said, ""we love you and support you"" we are forever in debt to them.

I look back now and remember my friends, the only people i trusted all died because they believed, because they were beautiful human beings, far braver than I.

I look back now and remember my father as he stood on Syrian soil for the very first time in 30 years and screamed into the crowd in Binnish ""we poets write with pens but you the people, you have written poetry with your blood""

I look back now and remember Bara al Bouhsi stripping his ranks of his shoulders and throwing his weapon to the ground swearing that he would never kill to gain justice only to die with his camera in his hand.

I look back now and remember the brother of a tortured revolutionary, he could not cope to imagine what his brother was going through, his brother died, as did he on a mission to relieve him of his pain.

I look back now and remember Syrians of all colors open their doors to freedom only to welcome murderers in, who would attempt destroy their lives.

I look back now and remember fleeing Syria and looking back at my country across the border with shame, I took picture that day to remind me of that feeling, that shame.

I look back and now and remember the look of my brothers face as he watches the pain of our people wreck their insanity, His words sink in me, his heart breaks my very essence. ارحمني يا ضياء

I look back now and remember who I was before all this, sure that thats still not what I want now, i could never give in to that, I love the people i met in this revolution.

I look back now and remind myself that even if there is no road forward there is no turning back, even if we must build our paths each individually and meet each other somewhere sooner or later, there is no turning back.

From now on if I am asked to rest I will say 'I look back now and remember; there is no reason to rest for there is no reason to forget'.""

Last night the Syrian regime dropped barrel bombs filled with chlorine gas onto civilians in Idlib. Six people were killed -- a grandmother, mother, father and three children. Dozens more were treated for gas inhalation at a nearby field hospital.

Today, the White Helmets are asking the United Nations Security Council to stop these chemical weapons being dropped - with a no-fly zone if necessary. The more of us who join the call, the greater the urgency on leaders to act.

The attack comes just 11 days after the UN Security Council voted on a resolution saying it would take further measures, including the possibility of military force, if chlorine gas was used again in Syria. Now it has been used. The Syrian regime is testing us -- if the international community doesn't take action, if our leaders break their word, it will be a green light for thousands more to be killed using poison gas.

The attack also comes 390 days after the UN Security Council passed a resolution banning the use of barrel bombs. Despite these threats the Syrian regime is doing nothing to ease its attacks on civilians. On Sunday it launched more than 200 air attacks.

She went for her final check up, and there was something wrong, and the doctor told her 'you have to give birth now'. But the hospitals weren't working because of the war, so my mum went to the house of a female doctor who had been delivering babies at home, and the baby was induced there.

But the doctor made a mistake and gave her more of the drug than her body could take. Her womb fell apart. They had to drive all the way to another town to get to a hospital. When they arrived she was almost dead, and the soldiers in front of the hospital had to give blood because she had lost so much.

My mum's heart stopped three times during the operation; three times the trainee doctors said 'she's dead, let's give up'. But the head doctor said 'No. We have to keep on' — and she survived.

So we really love our baby sister. She talks now and whenever she says anything people fall in love with her. She's a miracle baby, and it's a miracle that our mum made it back to life again.

The doctors were suggesting different names — 'Life', 'Survivor', but my mum had already decided on 'Peace'.""

It's a huge victory for all of us who care about world heritage and want to prevent that priceless history being sold into weapons. We have known for a long time that the dramatic looting and destruction of historical sites in Syria has been a source of income for fighters on all sides.

Eight months ago, when we started this campaign together nobody was pushing for a UN ban on the trade in Syrian antiquities. So how did we get here?

- In July we launched a public petition calling for the UN ban -  22,432 people signed from more than 125 countries, promoted by people with millions of followers like Ian McKellen (or Gandalf, to some of us)

- In September we spoke to archaeologists and art historians around the world publishing an open letter with more than 80 prominent academics calling on the UN to introduce the ban. The story was featured in the New York Times, LA Times, Newsweek and others. Experts kept signing on - last week before the ban was introduced we passed 250 names.

- We were also invited to assist the sanctions monitoring team from the UN Security Council by providing valuable information on how looted antiquities were funding Isis and the Al Nusra Front group

- Then in December, we participated in a UNESCO conference along with high-level politicians and professionals focusing on the protection of cultural heritage in Syria and Iraq

And now, finally, in February of 2015 we have a UN ban.

An achievement of this scale is never down to an individual or group and there have been dozens of experts and diplomats from around the world who have been pushing to make this ban happen. There are too many to list but this would never have happened without their efforts. Huge thank you to them.

But the real heroes protecting the world's heritage in Syria are the archaeologists on the ground. Every day they are putting their lives in danger by protecting sites and convincing their communities not to turn to looting as the pressures of the conflict deepen. They do this so that people they will never meet in future generations can appreciate the deep cultural legacy of Syria's ancient history. Like the heritage these heroes are attempting to defend, they live and work on all sides in the Syrian conflict and represent a hope that one day we can heal the rifts in my country by reconnecting with the symbols that unite us.

It is my deepest hope that as we build this campaign from this significant achievement, we can do more to support those doing that critical frontline work.

Thank you for being a part of it,

A barrel bomb fell in the Sad al-Wazz neighborhood, so the rest of my team rushed to the site. At one point they came back and woke me up suddenly. They told me there was a man stuck beneath the rubble. I got dressed immediately and accompanied them to area.

The man was trapped in a narrow place. I made a hole in the ceiling and crawled inside to where he was. I started clearing up the stones from around him. Just as I was almost done freeing his head and reassuring him that it was all almost over, I heard a terrible noise. I looked through the hole I had crept through, and I saw legs running. There was another explosion and I saw light and flames and the walls and ceilings started to fall on top of me.

My clothes were shredded due to the force of the explosion. My abdomen became swollen, but then went back to its usual size. My entire body felt funny. I fainted and then when I woke up I started shouting and yelling but it was all in vain. I checked my body for injuries and luckily everything was fine so I started moving the stones and dirt from around me and tearing things apart with my fingers. I was terrified that I was going to be stuck there forever. I kept working for half an hour and only then did I find a small gap for breathing – I felt like I was reborn.

Yesterday rich countries met and agreed to resettle only 38,000 new refugees of the 3.3 million who have fled for their lives. This is the world's shame.

Over the last few weeks people like you have come together to send 10,000's of emails to European leaders, and with other organisations we've pushed the scandal of resettlement pledges from the back rooms of the UN to the front page of the news. But even that wasn't enough for yesterday -- national interests were too entrenched, politicians too scared of the right wing press and the compassion we needed them to demonstrate was almost entirely missing.

In the middle of pushing this campaign on resettlement another story hit the headlines: the World Food Programme suspended food vouchers to 1.7 million refugees due to a lack of funding from governments. 

WFP said part of the reason for suspending the food vouchers was because of ""unfulfilled promises"" from governments so we started to dig into the official UN figures - and we found a big, unexplained hole? With only 21 days left in 2014, the European Commission has failed to pay $48 million dollars it promised.  

So let's call on the European Commission to pay the missing $48 million immediately. This money has been promised to some of the world's most vulnerable.

A barrel bomb fell in the Sad al-Wazz neighborhood, so the rest of my team rushed to the site. At one point they came back and woke me up suddenly. They told me there was a man stuck beneath the rubble. I got dressed immediately and accompanied them to area.

The man was trapped in a narrow place. I made a hole in the ceiling and crawled inside to where he was. I started clearing up the stones from around him. Just as I was almost done freeing his head and reassuring him that it was all almost over, I heard a terrible noise. I looked through the hole I had crept through, and I saw legs running. There was another explosion and I saw light and flames and the walls and ceilings started to fall on top of me.

My clothes were shredded due to the force of the explosion. My abdomen became swollen, but then went back to its usual size. My entire body felt funny. I fainted and then when I woke up I started shouting and yelling but it was all in vain. I checked my body for injuries and luckily everything was fine so I started moving the stones and dirt from around me and tearing things apart with my fingers. I was terrified that I was going to be stuck there forever. I kept working for half an hour and only then did I find a small gap for breathing – I felt like I was reborn. 

Even though the air I breathed was full of gunpowder, it was the cleanest I'd inhaled in hours. I fell unconscious again and when I woke up, I was safe in the hospital. Thank god for everything. The only thing that was on my mind was my daughter. Only my daughter.""

""My name is Fatima and I am a mother of three young girls in one of the most dangerous cities in the world. I am a volunteer for the White Helmets in Idlib. I help save people from destruction, from the daily barrel bombs and other attacks on Syrian civilians.

I have a dream of building my country side by side with men. I drive an ambulance and help injured civilians every day, knowing that this will give my daughter and my country a better future.
I am writing to you today to ask for your help to get an ambulance for our women's team here and an ambulance for the Idlib team. We are now 56 women in Syrian Civil Defence, and having this victory will help us grow and grow.

The women of the White Helmets are trained, kitted up and ready to save lives. But they need six ambulances, each costing $15,000. If we all chip in what we can afford, together we can buy these ambulances - it's the most direct way you can save lives in Syria today.

Until last month, almost all official members of the White Helmets were men. But now, two women's teams have been established -- and many more volunteers want to join them. Together, we can give them the giant boost they need by equipping two teams from Idlib and Aleppo with ambulances to respond to barrel bomb and missile attacks. 

Every day, these women rush to these scenes of destruction. With light tools and their bare hands, they dig survivors out from under the rubble. They give them medical care, and transport them to safety. And they risk their lives to do this. Often a helicopter or a jet will be circling overhead to launch another strike when rescuers and neighbours have gathered at the scene. 

Chip in what you can -- each donation will help these brave women save lives in Syria. And if you can't donate - please share!

We had to bring people down the balconies with the help of the fire fighting teams, because the stairs were destroyed.

This man was inside one of the burning shops. He was conscious but he had lost both legs - they were cut by a fragment of the barrel.

He wasn't able to see anything which scared him so much as you can probably can imagine what the last thing he'd seen was.

He needed to feel someone was with him all the time, so he held tight to that man's hand and wouldn't let go. In this picture we were looking at the destruction trying to find a safe way through to the ambulance.

18 people died that day and 30 were injured. Just another day in Aleppo.""

Everything was stolen from our house in Syria, I did only take my laptop with me. I want to be good in school and hope that the war in Syria ends. In the future I would love to work as a doctor like my father.

I did not do anything on my birthday, but it was also the day when school started and I was very happy about this. And my father gave me a cake.

Everyone in the world should at least care a little about Syria, because it is terrible and many people have already died.""

It was close to the time people break their daily Ramadan fast in the crowded market. People haggled over prices of watermelons and food to take home to their families. It wasn't the time to be worrying, it was meant to be a time to celebrate - but within a moment all this changed. The government indiscriminately dropped a bomb on a populated area in the liberated part of Aleppo.

It was a massacre. Over tens of bodies had been found dead, many wounded. The smoke was clearing and the ambulances were on their way. We heard the second bomb go off in the distance and it gave us the message that we could work.

Over a hundred people scrambled carrying bodies, some wounded but most were dead. Those moving the debris were cursing the Syrian government and calling out in Allah's name for the misery to end.

I quickly photographed and then headed to the next site of the second barrel bomb. It was by a building in a quiet street. It was ripped apart at the foundations and it had the windows of what seemed to be a sports complex. Young men in karate uniforms stained with blood emerged, their faces confused and shocked trying to make sense of what had just happened.

Men with white helmets moved swiftly into the building helping to bring out the wounded. The building seemed on the verge of collapse but the men moved swiftly, organised.

The White Helmets as they are known work 24/7, everyday saving lives. Most have never had proper medical training, only the willingness to organise and head into danger in an effort to save lives. As the building began to buckle, part of a wall crumbled covering them in dust but they kept on searching until everyone could be accounted for.

As quickly as they had arrived, the White Helmets rushed to take the wounded to underground hospitals to help get them urgent treatment.""

The next day, someone from the Hanano rescue team [another part of Aleppo] called me to say that they need me there. I thought they must be facing a major crisis to want another team's support.

I was depressed and confused and felt unable to do anything. I rushed there but when I arrived the situation was already very bad. Abdo, the little boy who was playing with me last night was gone. I collected the pieces of him I could find and put them in this blanket.

The Syrian government has been dropping 'barrel bombs' on civilian areas despite a UN order to stop, targeting schools and hospitals. Those too poor to flee their homes can only hope that if the bomb drops, the White Helmets will be there to help get them out.

More than 30 volunteers have been killed in the the past few months alone.

They lack the basic kit they need to save more lives - shovels, helmets, air-raid sirens. We can pressure donor governments to release critical funding for these heroes.

Well now it's time to hear about the good guys. Syria has heroes.

The 'White Helmets', the volunteers of the Syrian Civil Defence save lives in the most dangerous place on earth. They don't kill, they don't even carry weapons. Instead they take a pledge of 'Humanity, Solidarity and Impartiality' in line with the international Civil Defence code to save lives wherever they can.

When the bombs rain down, the White Helmets rush in, looking for survivors amongst the rubble. Volunteer medics, firefighters and search & rescue workers many have paid the ultimate price to protect life - more than 30 have been killed in the past few months alone.

It's a symptom of modern reporting that you only hear about the bad guys. But Syria has heroes and they need the world's support.

The White Helmets are desperate for life-saving kit, from helmets to digging tools and air-raid sirens. There is money - governments around the world have pledged millions to support Syria but yet these brave men and women often lack the basics.

Please share their stories with the world. You can make these heroes famous and get them the life-saving support they need.

SIGN: http://bit.ly/VBCoDl

There are five Syrians currently on Manus island in Papua New Guinea where Australia has sent these asylum seekers. The centre is essentially a prison. The Syria Campaign spoke last week to three Lebanese citizens who had been detained with the five Syrians and spoke of the horrific conditions in which they are being held. The authorities have even separated these Syrians from each other to try and keep them quiet.

We are used to seeing the horror of Syria and Iraq on our TV screens and newspapers but what Australia is doing right now to the world's most vulnerable is no better. The Syrians have been hunger striking and one of them is even in a wheelchair he is so weak.

YOU CAN SPEAK OUT FOR THEM. Please share this story far and wide and sign the petition to the Australian government to stop imprisoning these Syrians and stop trying to send them back to a war zone.

To: Children of Syria in Jordan Refugee Camp

How are you my dear brothers and sisters? How is your situation over there? I hope you are fine. I am greeting you and I am alright and trying my best to settle down in my studies.

My brothers and sisters, I know that in your country there is war but no matter, work hard in your life.
So, I am encouraging you to learn and be educated in your country and go on with your learning. Without education, it is like you are in a dark place. So don't be hopeless, we are with you and if there is war in your country tolerance is necessary.

My friends I am telling you education is the key to success in your life, so be confident and be patient. I am advising you to go back to your country and build back your nation so that it may be good and well and the more you get tolerant the more you get goodness. So, be powerful to your country and be polite.

Are you working hard at your schools? Remember education is important in this world and over. So school is fine. It's only through education that you can live a better life.
I am wishing success in your life. May Allah bring back peace and stability in your country. I say goodbye my young brother and sister and have less worry and nice time. God bless you all.

Your loving sister,

I borrowed a Tesla model S for the weekend to try out its new Autopilot system, which gives the Â£80,000 car some autonomous driving features.
I was very cautious at first about allowing the system, which keeps you in lane at a constant speed, to do its work. 
At times, it felt that we were getting uncomfortably close to the car in front â€“ so I braked cutting off the function.
Eventually, though, I realised that the system was working very well. 
When a car cut in front of me, it slowed down rapidly, and it coped well with changes in the speed of the traffic.
I'm not sure whether this halfway house to full autonomy really adds much for a cautious driver like me â€“ you still need to keep your hands on the wheel and foot hovering over the brake.
But the sheer power of the Tesla and the technology behind it is a hugely impressive advert for electric driving. However, until the price comes down by 75% and charge points are installed down every street, it's bound to remain a minority interest.

The question is how can it continue to grow? Surely it will plateau at some point, right? Yes - but we're a long way off that.

I've just come back from a meeting at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, to discuss some of the projects the social network has in the pipeline. 

On the wall, a map of the world highlighting countries with lots of Facebook users. Sure, the US and Europe are almost at peak Facebook.

But there are huge gaps. Africa, much of Asia, some of Latin America.

That's where Facebook is focused on now. To gain users here it is investing in new ways to get people online. Last month we heard about the British-designed drone it'll soon start trialling, designed to give connectivity to areas that currently have none.

Soon a billion in one day will be nothing out of the ordinary.

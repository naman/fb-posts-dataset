The population of India is expected to rise to 2 billion by 2040. And with the economy growing rapidly, our consumption pattern is massively changing. 

Ten-twenty years from now, our wants were fewer. We bought clothes on occasions and ate food that was simpler. But as money in our hands in increasing, we buy more than required and spend more than needed. 

In our quest for comfort, we often forget that resources are limited. Over-consumption and wastage are degrading our environment - the air we breathe, and the water we consume - and it needs to be curbed. 

As individuals, what efforts do you think we can take to lead simpler lives? What efforts can we take to stop over-consumption and reduce wastage?

The nuclear accident was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel. The resulting steam explosion and fires released 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere.

Uncontrolled reaction conditions resulted in a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air fire. Practically all of the radioactive material would go on to fall onto much of the surface of Ukraine and Europe.

Two Chernobyl plant workers died on the night of the accident, and a further 28 people died within a few weeks as a result of acute radiation poisoning.

The disaster shocked the whole world and evoked a major debate on nuclear energy and radioactive waste management. 

Today, the ""Chernobyl Exclusion Zone"" is largely uninhabited. Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding in the area are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest.

The Gestapo was the secret police of Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe during the Second World War.

The Gestapo's main purpose was to hunt down those considered a threat to Nazi Germany. This included Jews, homosexuals, liberals, journalists – basically, anyone who was thought to challenge the Nazi Party.

The secret police of the Gestapo played a key role in the terror and control of German citizens. They operated without civil restraints and their actions were not subject to review by the courts.

The Gestapo's greatest weapon was not its ruthless members or its torture chambers. The Gestapo's greatest weapon was the fear that it created. They seemed to have ears and spies everywhere, all across Germany. They created an atmosphere where nobody could trust anybody out of fear if they were a Gestapo informant. Indeed, 80% of all Gestapo investigations were started in response to information provided by ordinary Germans.

After the war, very few of the important members of the Gestapo were caught and brought to trial.

Dr Gupta dared to take on the infamous and powerful Entry Mafia of Bihar. For his efforts, the Mafia filed a false corruption case against him, had his house unlawfully raided, and had him imprisoned for a month – all for raising his voice against injustice.

The Patna High Court, the Supreme Court, and the IAS Officers Association rushed to rescue Dr Gupta and get him bailed. Yesterday, the state government also dropped the frivolous charges against Dr Gupta. 

Despite the unfairness and threats he faced, Jitendra Gupta is continuing his crusade against Bihar's Entry Mafia.

""I joined the Indian Administrative Service to bring systemic reforms and serve society,"" Jitendra Gupta told The Logical Indian recently. ""This service seriously provides a very large platform to bring positive changes in the lives of millions of poor and needy. Neither is my case the first one nor will it be the last one.""

""Those willing to fight corruption must be ready to face such things. Though such incidents of harassment and victimisation disturb for a while but there are good people within the service and other institutions who come forward to protect you from such vested interests. If you are right, you need not worry.""

And there are many instances where fake news has had real life consequences, leading to actual violence and people getting hurt. 

Fake news is dangerous to democracy. If information is corrupted, the national debate is diluted and democracy is weakened. The viral nature of fake news has established a culture of lies and misinformation which continues to grow unchecked.

What should be done to stop the spreading of fake news?

Good evening, Logical Indians!

In one of the worst road accidents, a bus carrying at least 47 passengers fell into a river in Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, killing at least 45 people. 

The driver and conductor knew about the vehicle's technical glitch, but kept driving, fearing that the passengers might ask for a ticket refund or a different mode of transportation. 

Despite the state authorities' plans to put up barricades on the sides of sharp road bends, no development had taken place in the last 10 years by both Congress and BJP. 

Road accidents in hilly areas are common with 4,488 accidents occurring in Himachal alone in the last 6 years. Overloading, no regular vehicle check-ups, drinking and driving, poor road infrastructure, and speeding in hilly areas are the primary reasons for such accidents. 

When nearly 50 people die in a road accident, who should be held responsible? The government or the driver of the vehicle?",,status,,2017-04-21 09:55:32,382,54,18,222,1,1,0,91,67

Good Evening, Community Members! 

In a 2006 judgement, the Supreme Court had directed the central and state governments to comply with a set of seven directives to make the police force more people-centric than ruler-centric. Setting up a police complaints authority for public complaints against police misconduct, and setting up a police establishment board to decide on transfers, postings and promotions, were some of its provisions. 

In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called for the making of SMART police - Sensitive, Mobile, Alert, Reliable and Techno-savvy.

11 years after the Supreme court order, do we see police as a sign of relief or trouble? Can we go to a police station and register a complaint without fear or ""money""? 

If not, then what measures do you think that the central and state governments should take to implement 7 directives of the Supreme court?",,status,,2017-04-20 09:15:00,119,32,9,113,1,1,1,2,1

The uprising was the largest revolt by Jews during the Holocaust. It took place in Warsaw, in Nazi-occupied Poland. The uprising opposed Nazi Germany's final effort to transport the remaining Ghetto (segregated areas for Jews and prisoners in Nazi-occupied Europe) population to the Treblinka death camp.

The uprising started on 19 April when the Ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander, who then ordered the burning of the Ghetto, block by block, ending on 16 May. The Jews were highly outnumbered and outgunned, and thus the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising failed. 

A total of 13,000 Jews died, about half of them burnt alive or suffocated (unofficial sources put the number of killed at above 50,000). German casualties were about 300. 

The Holocaust was a genocide during World War II in which some six million European Jews were killed by Adolf Hitler-led Nazi Germany and the Nazis' allies. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the continent's Jewish population. The Holocaust's victims also included prisoners of war, Gypsies, differently-abled people, communists, and homosexuals.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/logical.indian/photos/a.430765593719832.1073741828.426895610773497/1219754378154279/?type=3,2017-04-19 04:45:00,321,30,48,234,1,0,0,75,11

Formed in 2011, South Sudan is the world's youngest country.

While the country's citizens are mainly Christian, the country's ethnic divisions are extremely complicated. South Sudan has over 60 ethnic groups. The two largest groups are the Dinka and the Nuer.

South Sudan's first – and present – President is Salva Kiir. He is from the Dinka tribe. In an attempt to ensure the unity of the new country, Kiir appointed Riek Machar (of the Nuer tribe) as his Vice President.

Kiir assumed that appointing Machar as his Vice President would unify the two main tribes of the country – the Dinka and the Nuer – and bring stability.

However, Kiir's gamble did not pay off. The tense peace between the Dinka and the Nuer was soon broken.

In December 2013, the civil war broke out. Forces loyal to Kiir clashed with those loyal to Machar. The fighting rapidly spread throughout the country and evolved into a full-scale ethnic conflict.

In 2016, the United Nations warned that the stage was set for genocide in South Sudan. Tensions between the tribes are escalating. All sides are recruiting new soldiers and stockpiling more weapons.

The stage was long set for a genocide in South Sudan. Now, the genocide has begun.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/logical.indian/photos/a.430765593719832.1073741828.426895610773497/1214323392030711/?type=3,2017-04-14 11:00:00,511,42,72,305,1,2,1,162,40

Jallianwala Bagh is a public garden in Amritsar, Punjab. 98 years ago, a crowd of nonviolent protesters and pilgrims celebrating Baisakhi gathered in Jallianwala Bagh. The protesters were voicing their opposition to the Rowlatt Act.

They were fired upon by troops of the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer. On Dyer's orders, his troops fired on the crowd for ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to flee. 

The British government released figures stating 379 dead and 1,200 wounded. Other sources place the number of dead at well over 1,000.

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre led to outrage across British India and the world. The Indian Independence Movement received renewed impetus; a few months later, the Non-cooperation Movement began. 

Dyer was removed from duty but he became a celebrated hero in Britain. He was awarded  £26,000 sterling (over £1,000,000 today) when he returned to the UK, where he was hailed as ""the Saviour of the Punjab with the sword of honour and a purse"".

One such act, passed on 11 September 1958, was applicable to the Naga Hills, then part of Assam. In the following decades, it spread to the other Seven Sister states in India's northeast. Another one passed in 1983 and applicable to Punjab and Chandigarh was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. 

An act passed in 1990 was applied to Jammu and Kashmir and has been in force since.

The Acts have received criticism from several sections for alleged concerns about human rights violations in the regions of its enforcement alleged to have happened. One of AFSPA's most vocal critics has been the human rights group Amnesty International.

The first Amnesty International office in India was first set up in India in Bihar in 1966. Today, Amnesty International India is a network of over 65,000 grassroots activists, journalists, and volunteers. Since then, the nonpartisan organisation has campaigned against torture, the death penalty and abusive laws, for women's rights, corporate accountability and free speech. It also seeks to promote human rights education in schools and colleges and describes itself as working to uphold rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India.

Be it in its vocal opposition to the Emergency, its stringent protests to bring the perpetrators of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to justice, its criticism of capital punishment, its campaign for tribal rights, or in its condemnation of AFSPA, Amnesty International India has been at the forefront of the battle to preserve human rights in India for decades.

'व्हीलचेयर पर करती थीं चुनाव प्रचार, एक रुपया खर्च किये बिना जीता चुनाव'

ओड़िशा से एक ऐसी कहानी सामने आ रही है जो भारतीय राजनीति की एक बिल्कुल अलग तस्वीर पेश करती है। यह कहानी एक ऐसी महिला की है, जिसने व्हीलचेयर पर रहते हुए ओड़िशा के पंचायत चुनाव में जीत का परचम लहराया। मिनती बारिक के दोनों पैरों में जान नहीं हैं पर उन्होंने इसकी परवाह किये बिना चुनाव लड़ा और लोगों ने अपने प्यार और स्नेह से उन्हें वार्ड मेंबर बनाया। मिनती ओड़िशा के कटानबनिया ग्राम पंचायत के बाजापुर गांव से वार्ड मेंबर चुनी गई हैं।

बचपन में ही मिनती के पैरों ने उनका साथ छोड़ दिया, वो बेहद गरीबी में पली बढ़ीं पर ये उनका लोगों की सेवा करने का जज़्बा और अपने ऊपर आत्मविश्वास ही था जिसने उन्हें यह सफलता दिलाई। गाँव के लोग मिनती की हिम्मत, दोस्ताना अंदाज़ और करुणामय स्वभाव से भलीभांति परिचित हैं। मिनती अपने क्षेत्र का दौरा भी व्हीलचेयर पर बैठ कर करतीं और घर-घर जातीं। गाँव में दुर्गम रास्तों पर वो अपने हाथ और पैर के बल चलकर अपना चुनाव प्रचार करतीं।

ओडिशा के सामाजिक कार्यकर्ता मोहम्मद इमरान अली ने मिनती की कहानी को सोशल मीडिया तक पहुँचाया। इमरान अली से बात करते हुए मिनती ने बताया, ""मैं बहुत गरीब परिवार से हूं, मेरा गुज़ारा 500 रूपये प्रति माह मिलने वाली विकलांग पेंशन से होता है पर यह मेरे गाँव के लोगों का मुझमें विश्वास था जिसने मुझे चुनाव लड़ने की प्रेरणा दी और फिर जीत की ओर अग्रसर किया।""

मिनती ने बताया, ""मैंने चुनाव में एक रुपये खर्च नहीं किये, मेरे पास ना पैसों का सहारा था और ना मेरे अपने पैरों का पर मेरा सहारा जनता बनी और मुझे यह सफलता मिली। मेरे पैरों में ताकत नहीं पर इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि मैं किसी की मोहताज हूँ, मेरे पास मेरी अपनी सिलाई मशीन है और वो मेरे गुज़र बसर के लिए काफी है।""

मिनती को उनके पैरों के लिए कुछ लोग चिढाते भी हैं पर वो इन सब पर ध्यान नहीं देतीं, उन्होंने चुनाव जीतकर लोगों की सेवा करने की ठानी है और वो इस सेवा के सफर पर आगे बढ़ चली हैं। मिनती का मकसद गांव के लोगों को सभी सरकारी सेवाओं का लाभ दिलाना और लोगों को बिना एक रुपया घूस दिए अपने काम करवाना है। वो अपने गाँव के सारे ग़रीबों का विशेष ख्याल रखना चाहती हैं और यह सुनिश्चित करना चाहती हैं कि कोई भी पीछे न छूट जाए।

मिनती की कहानी से समाज और खासकर हमारे नेताओं को भी बहुत कुछ सीखने को मिलता है. मिनती एक आवाज़ हैं, जो सत्ता में दिव्यांग लोगों की भागीदारी को बढ़ावा देने के लिए पर्याप्त है। तर्कसंगत मिनती के हौसले और जज़्बे को सलाम करता है और आशा करता है कि लोग उनकी कहानी को पढ़कर प्रेरणा लेंगे।",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/logical.indian/photos/a.430765593719832.1073741828.426895610773497/1208975045898879/?type=3,2017-04-10 08:00:00,313,4,24,296,9,8,0,0,0

Their trip led to dialogue between the two nations and opened the door for US President Richard Nixon's historic China visit in 1972. 

The two countries' table tennis teams engaged in ""ping-pong diplomacy"" in China for 10 days. When the 15-member American team left China, ""the ping was heard around the world"". The events of April 1971 led to the Chinese sending their own table tennis team to the US for an eight-city tour. Within the next year, America and China would open relations and set a new chapter in world history. 

The ""ping-pong diplomacy"" of 1971 was unprecedented and shocked everyone. It helped improve relations between two countries that were extremely distrustful of each other at a time when the threat of global war was everywhere.

Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the US. He said: ""The people are just like us. They are real, they're genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It's beautiful.""

आप ने तब यात्राओं के बारे में लिखना शुरू किया कि जब इसका चलन नहीं था। आप ट्रेवल लिटरेचर के पिता माने जाते हैं। आप ने भारत के कई शहरों में भ्रमण किया और साथ ही दुनिया के कई मुल्क जैसे चीन, तिब्बत, सोवियत संघ, ईरान इत्यादि गए और अपनी ज़िंदगी के लगभग 45 साल यात्राओं में गुज़ार दिए।

आप को 'महापंडित' भी कहा जाता है और मज़े की बात ये है कि उनकी धर्म में आस्था नहीं थी, आप ने हिन्दू और मुसलमान, दोनों पर बहुत कटाक्ष किया और लिखा।

आप 20 से ज़्यादा भाषाएं जानते थे और सामाजिक न्याय और इंसानियत की बातें करते थे, इसके लिए आप कई बार जेल गए। आप अपनी इस समाज को धर्म और जाति से ऊपर उठकर जीते देखना चाहते थे और यही सपना लेकर आप इस दुनिया से चले गए।

आप को साहित्य अकादमी पुरस्कार मिला और पद्म भूषण भी। आप शहर आज़मगढ़ से थे, आप महापंडित राहुल सांकृत्यायन जी थे।

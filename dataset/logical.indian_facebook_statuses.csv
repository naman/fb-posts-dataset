426895610773497_1231051760357874,"""The truth is that the population bomb is being defused round the world. But the consumption bomb is still primed and ever more dangerous. It is over-consumption related to over-population that matters"" - Fred Pearce

The population of India is expected to rise to 2 billion by 2040. And with the economy growing rapidly, our consumption pattern is massively changing. 

Ten-twenty years from now, our wants were fewer. We bought clothes on occasions and ate food that was simpler. But as money in our hands in increasing, we buy more than required and spend more than needed. 

In our quest for comfort, we often forget that resources are limited. Over-consumption and wastage are degrading our environment - the air we breathe, and the water we consume - and it needs to be curbed. 

As individuals, what efforts do you think we can take to lead simpler lives? What efforts can we take to stop over-consumption and reduce wastage?

Most of us have encountered the advent of WhatsApp ""news"" in the form of WhatsApp forwards. And most of us share news and opinions online. 

Do we verify our posts before sharing them on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp or other social networking platforms?

Secularism is one of the most important components of democracy. The Preamble to the Constitution asserts that India is a secular nation, and India has no concept of a state/national religion. While most of us agree that secularism is compulsory for a healthy democracy, each of us tends to have a different understanding of secularism.

According to you, what is secularism?

Fake news is exploding in India, a country which has 50 million WhatsApp accounts and 200 million Facebook users. It is everywhere: created by propagandists and shared by impressionable people. And there are many instances where fake news has had real life consequences, leading to actual violence and people getting hurt. 

Fake news is dangerous to democracy. If information is corrupted, the national debate is diluted and democracy is weakened. The viral nature of fake news has established a culture of lies and misinformation which continues to grow unchecked.

What should be done to stop the spreading of fake news?

In one of the worst road accidents, a bus carrying at least 47 passengers fell into a river in Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, killing at least 45 people. 

The driver and conductor knew about the vehicle's technical glitch, but kept driving, fearing that the passengers might ask for a ticket refund or a different mode of transportation. 

Despite the state authorities' plans to put up barricades on the sides of sharp road bends, no development had taken place in the last 10 years by both Congress and BJP. 

Road accidents in hilly areas are common with 4,488 accidents occurring in Himachal alone in the last 6 years. Overloading, no regular vehicle check-ups, drinking and driving, poor road infrastructure, and speeding in hilly areas are the primary reasons for such accidents. 

When nearly 50 people die in a road accident, who should be held responsible? The government or the driver of the vehicle?",,status,,2017-04-21 09:55:32,382,54,18,222,1,1,0,91,67

In a 2006 judgement, the Supreme Court had directed the central and state governments to comply with a set of seven directives to make the police force more people-centric than ruler-centric. Setting up a police complaints authority for public complaints against police misconduct, and setting up a police establishment board to decide on transfers, postings and promotions, were some of its provisions. 

In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called for the making of SMART police - Sensitive, Mobile, Alert, Reliable and Techno-savvy.

11 years after the Supreme court order, do we see police as a sign of relief or trouble? Can we go to a police station and register a complaint without fear or ""money""? 

If not, then what measures do you think that the central and state governments should take to implement 7 directives of the Supreme court?",,status,,2017-04-20 09:15:00,119,32,9,113,1,1,1,2,1

IIT Kharagpur has announced that it will introduce basic courses in Vastu Shastra for architecture students from August 2017. More detailed courses will be available for post-graduate students. The move, officials say, is to ""balance"" architectural concepts, which have been primarily based on ""Western schools of thought"".

What do you think of this step by IIT Kharagpur?

There has been a lot of talk about the term ""anti-national"". It has been used widely by politicians, the media, and the public. However, there is no set definition of the term itself. 

According to you, what is the meaning of the term ""anti-national""?

Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code states, ""Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.""

There have been many cases where people have been booked under defamation in India. Shiv Sena MP who assaulted an Air India staff has also filed a defamation case against the airlines for disgracing his image.

Do you think that the law related to defamation should exist in our country? Or should the law be completely removed?",,status,,2017-04-11 09:15:01,83,40,5,75,2,0,1,0,5

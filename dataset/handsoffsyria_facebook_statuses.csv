Weapons from a NATO member state have ended up in the hands of Jihadists in Syria that is according to an investigation carried out by a Bulgarian journalist. A commander from the western-backed FSA claims the US-led coalition is aware of this but chooses to look the other way. 

RT's Emily Sui investigates.

100681426711941_1335777746535630,"#Syria and Khan al-Assal Massacre: A forerunner to False Chemical Flag in #KhanSheikhoun against Syria

In Khan al-Assal over 150 people were brutally murdered by al-Qaeda affiliates and remnants of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in 2013. Yet, the significance of Khan al-Assal applies to the chemical issue, whereby the Syrian government is adamant that terrorists were responsible for a past attack – just like recent intrigues in Khan Sheikhoun in 2017. Hence, when viewing the methodology of the massacre, then something doesn't meet the eye because it appears to have been done based on other motives. This notably applies to covert operatives from sinister shadows. In other words, this bears all the hallmarks of the recent bombing of Syria in 2017 by President Donald Trump because something is afoot. Therefore, all roads to Khan al-Assal in 2013 and Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 point to the enemies of Damascus in relation to events involving chemicals.

Khan al-Assal massacre in 2013 and Chemical False Flag related to 2017

Officially, the terrorist group called the Ansar al-Khilafa Brigade in 2013 claimed responsibility but the behaviour of the massacre leads to doubts about the sole responsibility of just terrorist forces. In the past, certain special covert operations have taken place against airfields and to firmly entrench various sectarian terrorist forces in northern Syria. Given the importance of Khan al-Assal in relation to the reported chemical attack and with the Russian Federation providing evidence which firmly pins chemical usage on terrorist forces – then was the massacre aimed at specific individuals and aimed at a cover-up related to this incident?

Khan al-Assal massacre in 2013 and events on the ground then

It was known that the Syrian armed forces were making headway in Homs and in other parts of Syria in this part of 2013. This reality makes the attack against Khan al-Assal appear even more like a covert operation because it is unimportant militarily given the recent setbacks by sectarian forces. While Ansar al-Khilafa claims responsibility for the massacre, and al Nusra played its part, it is doubtful that such an operation is possible without extremely professional individuals being involved. Therefore, the timing of the attack would indicate that covert operatives were involved and hiding in the shadows, whereby terrorist groups held to be accountable became a convenient cover for the many intrigues against Syria. After all, only America, France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom could gain from this massacre because it can help to literally ""bury the truth"" about their respective false pretexts, in relation to the chemical issue.

The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the barbaric massacre by stating that, ""The gunmen of the two terrorist groups have perpetrated a brutal crime two days ago in Khan al-Asal which they captured on July 22nd, 2013.""

The ministry further stated, ""The fighters of the two extremist groups have committed genocide against the captives of the Syrian officers and soldiers as well as against the pro-government civilians.""

Dr. Riad Haddad, the Syrian Ambassador based in Moscow at the time of the massacre in 2013, was in no doubt that the barbaric massacre in Khan al-Assal was aimed at erasing the chemical false flag. He stated to Ria Novosti that ""The main goal of this carnage which was committed by Jabhat al-Nusra and Ansar al-Khliafa brigade is killing all witnesses on the use of the chemical weapons use by the armed terrorist groups.""

Surely, with infighting at the time between al-Qaeda affiliates and the FSA; internal tensions between various al-Qaeda groups; Nusra and the FSA attacking the Kurds near the border with Turkey and in other areas; alongside setbacks against the Syrian armed forces; then Khan al-Assal makes no strategic sense apart from covering up the crimes of the chemical attack. Also, the nature of the coordination of the attack hints to the involvement of special operatives and a planned attack from much higher.

It must be remembered that while the Syrian government was open to a proper investigation by the United Nations (UN) based on neutral observers; this unnerved many nations within the Gulf and Western terrorist alliance. The terrorist operation – or the joint covert operation – is known to have taken place by some individuals in virtually full disguise and having professional military builds – alongside the vast majority of ordinary members of both terrorist groups that did the massacre itself. It resembles a joint operation whereby the orders were planned by ""outside forces"" and because of strong motivational factors that lead to a cover up.

RIA Novosti stated, ""Over the weekend ""it became known about the atrocious killing"" of some 150 people by militants from extremist groups Jabhat al-Nusra and Ansar al-Khilafah during an attack on Khan Assal, a town outside the northern city of Aleppo, the ministry said in a statement on its website.""

RIA Novosti continued, ""Both militant groups, which have conducted joint operations in the past, have claimed credit for taking control of Khan Assal on July 22-23 and killing more than 100 soldiers.""

Like usual, the leaders of America, France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom in 2013 all remained mainly silent about this brutal massacre. These four NATO powers also have collectively agreed to allow NATO Turkey to be a conduit for al-Qaeda affiliates and other terrorist forces entering northern Syria via Turkey. Similarly, weapons to al-Qaeda terrorists, sectarian forces, and covert operatives are happening based on the role of NATO Turkey. However, this seems to be bypassing a mainly compliant and propaganda based media.

Carla Del Ponte in this period headed an independent commission of inquiry in relation to the possible usage of chemicals for the United Nations. She expressed, ""investigators have been in neighbouring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated… This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities.""

In another article by Modern Tokyo Times about the chemical false flag it was stated that ""It appears that the axis-of-evil against Syria will tolerate beheading people, daily terrorism, religious cleansing, killing journalists, kidnapping Christian bishops, taking UN personnel and making them hostages, killing mainstream Sunni clerics which support the independence of Syria, throwing people from rooftops and destroying Christian churches and Shia mosques. Will political elites in Ankara, Doha, London, Paris, Riyadh and Washington now "" see the light"" and acknowledge that their ""terrorist and sectarian freedom fighters"" are simply barbaric? Or, will the mass media peddle more lies in order to brush the latest news about sarin gas under the carpet; in order to meet the demands of political elites that have various agendas in destabilising and crushing the last major secular Arabic-speaking nation in the Middle East?""

It is clear that America, France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom have a lot of blood on their hands because all four nations have supported Qatar and Saudi Arabia in their ""unholy and immoral war."" This applies to helping the terrorist, military, and covert ratlines against Syria. The massacre in Khan al-Assal didn't serve the agenda of al-Qaeda affiliates and the FSA in relationship to the current military situation at the time in Syria. However, the massacre and barbaric atrocity did serve nations with ""a false flag agenda"" that needed to cover up the chemical angle.

US and bombing of Syria in 2017

Sadly, in 2017 it seems once more that Syria is being accused without any international investigation into an alleged chemical attack that took place recently. After all, with the Syrian armed forces being in better shape now than at any other time since outside nations began to destabilise Syria, then why would the government in Damascus commit such an own goal?

Equally, just like then, it is clear that some images don't make sense. For example, some images show a little child with her throat cut – yet, with Syria bombing from the sky then how could chemicals kill like this? Similarly, the alleged evidence is tainted by the source being the White Helmets – and other players being involved including Turkey manipulating information for personal gains. This is based on images of the White Helmets being seen firmly within sectarian and Takfiri networks with links to al-Qaeda and other brutal sectarian forces.

Modern Tokyo Times says, ""The devastating loss of innocent life in Khan Sheikhoun is truly tragic but sadly it is just a propaganda scoop for the enemies of Syria. Instead, real questions should be asked. For example, why did sectarian terrorists allow children to be in such close proximity to a munitions area known for making weapons?""

It should be noted that allies of America – and the intrigues of Obama prior to Trump – have all assisted various sectarian forces and militias that have links to al-Qaeda and other brutal Takfiri groups. Yet, somehow, it is fine for NATO Turkey to be an open conduit for international jihadists. Similarly, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are never held accountable for supporting brutal sectarian forces that follow the mantra of ""Alawites to the grave, Christians to Beirut."" Therefore, the usual Gulf and NATO powers – including France and the United Kingdom – are never held accountable for the cleansing of Alawites, Christians, Yazidis (Iraq), and endless terrorist attacks against the Shia.

Events in Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 resemble past brutal intrigues in Khan al-Assal way back in 2013. Likewise, past propaganda videos involve kidnapped Alawite children by several Sunni Takfiri groups, who were killed for propaganda purposes. Alas, once more the mass media and gullible international politicians are open to Gulf and NATO propaganda – with some leaders openly being devious – because of an agenda being set in the corridors of power in America, France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

In all truth, why would Syria and the Russian Federation seek to provide the enemies of both nations with ample power to isolate them further – and, to enforce the political elites of Moscow to abandon Damascus? After all, it is abundantly clear that the situation is more stable and encouraging for the government of Syria in 2017. Similarly, the timing of the intrigue came shortly after America appeared to be softening against Syria. Hence, two birds were killed with one stone in Khan Sheikhoun – this applies to maintaining the conflict in Syria and boosting more pressure on Assad in order to oust him – and, secondly, the naivety of Trump means that American and Russian relations are in tatters once more.

US president Donald Trump is not a truly independent political leader but merely a puppet of US corporations, military and intelligence, and who serves their interests, Syrian President Bashar Assad has told the Latin American #TeleSUR TV network.

Trump pursues ""no own policies"" but only executes the decisions made by the ""intelligence agencies, the Pentagon, the big arms manufacturers, oil companies, and financial institutions,"" the Syrian leader said in an exclusive interview with TeleSUR.

""As we have seen in the past few weeks, he changed his rhetoric completely and subjected himself to the terms of the deep American state, or the deep American regime,"" Assad added.

He referred to the fact that Trump came to power on a political platform promising a departure from the interventionist policy of the previous US president, Barack Obama, but soon forgot his promises and ordered a missile strike against the Syrian air base following a chemical weapons incident in Syria's Idlib province.

The Syrian president also said that it is ""a complete waste of time to make an assessment of the American president's foreign policy"" as ""he might say something"" but what he really does depends on ""what these [US military and business] institutions dictate to him.""

He also added that it ""is not new"" and ""has been ongoing American policy for decades.""

""This is what characterizes American politicians: they lie on a daily basis... That's why we shouldn't believe what the Pentagon or any other American institution says because they say things which serve their policies, not things which reflect reality and the facts on the ground,"" Assad told TeleSUR.

He went on to say that the US continues to pursue its age-long policy aimed at establishing and maintaining a global hegemony by turning all countries that oppose it into war zones.

""The United States always seeks to control all the states of the world without exception. It does not accept allies, regardless of whether they are developed states as those in the Western bloc or other states of the world,"" the Syrian leader explained.

He also added that ""what is happening to Syria, to Korea, to Iran, to Russia, and maybe to Venezuela now, aims at re-imposing American hegemony on the world because they believe that this hegemony is under threat now, which consequently threatens the interests of American economic and political elites.""

Assad expressed similar views in an interview with Russia's Sputnik news agency about a week ago. ""The regime in the United States hasn't changed,"" he said, adding, ""since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has been attacking different countries in different ways without taking into consideration the Security Council or the United Nations.""

He also said that for the US, ""the end justifies the means, no values, no morals at all, anything could happen.""

Despite his criticism, Assad once again confirmed the readiness of the Syrian government to cooperate with the US if it could change its attitude towards respecting other countries' sovereignty and that of Syria in particular.

The 1st national media conference continued its activities on Monday as the discussions of the participants focused on the ""religious dimension in the media"".

The participants' interventions focused on the possibility of replacing the material of religious education in the curriculum with the subject of ethics and the role of the Ministry of Awqaf (Religious Endowments) in the education of true Islam.

The participants inquired about the role of the Awqaf Ministry in enlightening and dispelling the dark thought that was instructed in the minds of some citizens, especially the children who stayed for years in unsafe areas.

The participants called for working on the selection of appropriate preachers and Imams and not to leave these platforms for some extremists and focus on showing the influence of religion in the application of morality and good treatment among people.

For his part, Minister of Awqaf (Religious Endowments) Mohammad Abdul-Sattar al-Sayyed affirmed that the media institutions in Syria broadcast the religious message in the right and proper manner, pointing out that the religious discourse in the media should focus on moral aspects and includes concepts of good, dignity and humanity in a way that contributes to the fight against Takfiri extremist thought.

As the development of religious discourse is the responsibility of the Ministry of Awqaf and all religious scholars, according to the minister, the ministry has worked to change the legal curricula, noting that ""changing the curriculum does not mean violating the constants, we should be at the same time sticking to it and developing religious discourse and fighting Takfiri mentality.""

Mikdad: Media should serve national identity

For his part, Deputy Foreign and expatriates Minister Fayssal Mikdad affirmed that media basically serves certain institutions, so it is not wrong for the Syrian media to serve the national identity.

During a session on ""diplomacy in Media"", Mikdad pointed out to the lies being practiced in this domain, and the ways of misleading followed to convince the public opinion, whether inside the US or outside it, to justify the US aggression on al-Shairat airport.

He reiterated that Syria has no chemical weapons.

The 1st national media conference kicked off on Sunday under the title The Right of the Citizen to Media, organized by the Information Ministry.

""It is absurd to believe that al-Qaïda and Daesh could be in possession of so much money and weaponry without the support of major states. It is absurd to believe that France could have participated in the remodelling operations in the « Greater Middle East » without suffering the counter-attacks. It is absurd to believe that it will be easy to fight international terrorism when it is commanded by our own NATO allies.""

100681426711941_1327975177315887,"#Syria | Here is the Full text of President #Assad 's #interview with #RIA_Novosti & #Sputnik

21 April 2017

President Bashar al-Assad stressed that what has been said on Khan Sheikhoun is  a fabricated story, adding that the West and the United States blocked any delegation from coming to investigate, because if they come, they will find that all their narratives about what happened in Khan Sheikhoun and then the attack on Shairat airport was a false flag, was a lie.

In an interview given to Russia's RIA Novosti and Sputnik news agencies, President al-Assad said that we always announce that we are ready to cooperate with any country who is genuinely ready or wants or has the will to fight terrorism.

He added that we already know that the West supports the terrorists and it doesn't have a will to fight them.

Following is the full text of the interview:

Question 1: Thank you, Mr. President, for giving an opportunity for this interview, and I will start with the recent tragic event in Aleppo, where the majority of those killed and wounded were children. Who do you think organized this crime, and on what purpose?

President Assad: A few months ago, the same agreement was about to be implemented, but as you know, you're talking about different factions, all of them are linked to Al Qaeda or al-Nusra Front, and one of those factions attacked the buses that wanted to transport the same civilians outside of al-Foua'a and Kefraya beside Aleppo, and they attacked those buses and they burned them, and it was shown on the internet, where they said ""we won't allow this reconciliation to happen, we're going to kill every civilian that wants to use the buses,"" and that's what happened. When we thought that everything is ready to implement that reconciliation, they did what they announced, and they are al-Nusra Front, they didn't hide themselves from the very beginning, and I think everybody agrees that this is al-Nusra.

Question 2: Any specific group or al-Nusra itself?

President Assad: No, because when you talk about al-Nusra, it's their ideology, so different names – and as you know al-Nusra itself changed its name – so different names doesn't mean changing the ideology or the behavior or the course of killing. So, it doesn't matter what's the name.

Question 3: And how many people have died since the beginning of the war, at this point?

President Assad: Actually, we can talk only about official numbers. It's tens of thousands, not like what you hear in the media about hundreds of thousands. Of course, we can talk about thousands of missing people that we don't know anything about their fate. This is the official number. But in the West, of course they add altogether the number of the terrorists, and a large amount of the terrorists of course they're not registered at the state as killed or dead, and the same thing about the foreigners who came to Syria in tens or maybe hundreds of thousands to fight. So, the numbers that we've been hearing in the Western media during the last six years were not precise, it's only to inflate the number just to show how horrible the situation, to use it as humanitarian pretext to intervene in Syria. So, as a state, we only talk about tens of thousands of victims till this moment.

Question 4: So, you're not agreeing with the number that the United Nations give?

President Assad: No, because the United Nations doesn't have any means to calculate the numbers, and actually no-one has, as I said, because you're talking about different factions; foreigners, Syrians and terrorists and so on, so it's complicated to tell. The only thing that we have are the official records. Of course, it must be higher than the official record, but we cannot just estimate and give any number.

Question 5: I see. Yesterday, there were reports that al-Baghdadi was captured by the Russian and Syrian military at the border of Syria and Iraq. Can you confirm it?

President Assad: No, no. That's not true.

Journalist: That's not true?

President Assad: No, no. That's not true. Anyway, those borders are under the control of ISIS till this moment., it's neither Syrian nor Russian, not even Western or American or any other one; it's only ISIS who's controlling those borders, so it's safe for al-Baghdadi to be in that area.

Question 6: Let's talk a little bit about this missile strike from the United States. So, the Shairat airbase quickly returned to its operation, but many wondered why the Syrian Army didn't hit the US missiles, didn't try to down it, why?

President Assad: Many people wonder about whether our air defense or the Russian air defense and they look at it as absolute power that can take down any missile. Technically, it's complicated, because the missile must see its target, let's say, our missile, and to see it you need a radar that can see every angle of the country which is impossible because you're talking about terrain and topography, and as you know the cruise missiles use those terrain in order to hide from the radar, so it needs an intensive system to see every angle, in that way you can take it down. This is one.
Second, maybe a few people knew that the terrorists at the very beginning of the attacks, they started by destroying the Syrian air defense, which has nothing to do with what they called it that time the ""peaceful demonstrations."" Most of the air defense are outside the cities in outlying areas, so they started attacking that air defense and it was affected dramatically during the crisis. So, you have many factors that could influence taking down those missiles.

Question 7: So, how many items from the air defense system you lost during these attacks by terrorists before the US launched its attack?

President Assad: A huge number, a huge number. It was the first target. The first target was the air defense. We don't have to give a precise number now, because as you know it's military information, but I can tell you more than fifty percent. Of course, the Russians, through their support to the Syrian Army, they compensated part of that loss with quality armaments and air defense systems, but this is not enough when you talk about a full country. It takes a long time to recover all your air defense.

Question 8: Are there any concrete negotiations underway with the Russians regarding the purchasing of new air defense systems?

President Assad: Yes, it's always the case, before the war and during the war. Of course, we need more armaments after the war and because of the consumption, and this is part of the daily relation between the two institutions in the Ministry of Defense in Russia and Syria.

Question 9: What kind of systems are you interested in now after the attack, like S-300, S-400, or what kind of system?

President Assad: Usually we're always interested in the last generation of any system, but that depends on what's available, that depends on the policy of the vendor, which is Russia, and that depends on the prices. You have many criteria and that depends of course on the specifications that you're looking for that could be suitable to your kind of war, to your army, to your terrain, to many other criteria that's related to the air defense.

Question 10: Has there been any talks of possible non-repayable deliveries, delivery for free from Russia, or is it a commercial contract?

President Assad: In this situation, I mean our war, Russia looks at this war as more than Syrian war, and more than Syrian-Russian war. I think it's the war of every country that wants to protect its citizens from the terrorists. So, when Russia supports our army, it not only protects the Syrian citizens, it also protects the Russian citizens, and I think the European and others. So, for them they don't look at it as commercial war like the Americans; when they launch a war they calculated how much jobs can you create out of this war. They look at it as a war that needs to protect their citizens, our citizens, other citizens, the position of Russia, the balance, the political balance, the military balance around the world, as a great country. So, in that regard, you don't look at the armaments as how much do they cost or how much do they bring as benefit or profit.

Question 11: Alright. So, Damascus has said that it is ready for the mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to come and to investigate the Khan Sheikhoun incident. Have there been any contacts between you and this organization, and what are the possible dates for the arrival of the first team of experts?

President Assad: Actually, since the first attack a few years ago that happened in Aleppo by the terrorists against our army, we asked the United Nations to send investigation delegation in order to prove what we said about the terrorists having gases used against our army, and later many incidents happened in that way, and they didn't send any delegation. It's the same now. We formally sent a letter to the United Nations, we asked them in that letter to send a delegation in order to investigate what happened in Khan Sheikhoun. Of course till this moment they didn't send, because the West and the United States blocked any delegation from coming, because if they come, they will find that all their narratives about what happened in Khan Sheikhoun and then the attack on Shairat airport was a false flag, was a lie. That's why they didn't send. Now the only contact I think is between Russia and maybe the other countries in order to send that delegation. Till this moment, we didn't have any positive news regarding any delegation coming.

Question 12: What is your view of what happened there? Because there were a lot of different reports of different kinds, and misinterpretation and accusation of fake news. So, what happened there according to your information?

President Assad: Actually, that area is under the control of al-Nusra Front which is Al Qaeda. The only information the whole world has is what this organization or this group – which is al-Nusra – published on YouTube, on the internet in general, and in different outlets, mainly Western outlets, so we cannot base our judgment on their reports. First of all, we don't know if the site that we attacked that day half an hour before noon, about 11:30, was a chemical warehouse or depot or anything like this. And their story said that the attack happened at 6, 6:30 in the morning. We didn't launch any attack at that time. So, you have two possibilities: the first one is that there was an attack at lunch time or at about 11:30. The other possibility that we believe in is that it was a false flag, there was no attack, all what we saw as pictures and videos was like the videos we've been seeing for the last year or two years or more regarding the White Helmets, the humanitarian Al Qaeda which is an elusive story, let's say, it doesn't exist anyway, and the picture that shows children being killed by Russian airstrike to discover later that it wasn't a real picture, they put a boy, they covered him with mud and blood, fake blood of course, and so on. All these ploys could be part of them. That's what we believe in, because the attack was already prepared, and they didn't want to listen, they didn't want to investigate; they only wanted to launch the attack. We believe it was a false flag for one reason and a simple reason: if there was gas leakage or attack, and you're talking about 60 dead in that city, how could the city continue its life normally? They didn't evacuate the city. No-one left the city, life continued as normal, and this is mass destruction. The other day, they attacked Shairat where they said there was the gas depots, and they attacked all the depots, and there was no gas coming out of that airport. No-one of our army officers or military staff, was affected by any gas. So, for us, there was no gas attack and no gas depot, it was a false flag play just to justify the attack on the Shairat base. That's what happened.

Question 13: So, the main version is that no chemical weapons or no chemicals were used there?

President Assad: No, I mean even if you look at the pictures, you can see that the rescuers – presumable rescuers – were rescuing people without masks, without gloves, and they were moving freely. How? This is against all the specifications of the sarin gas that they talked about. They cannot, they would have been dead like the others, and you don't know that those people who are lying on the ground were dead or not. You can fake this image, it's very easy. So, you cannot just base your judgment on images and videos, especially made by Al Qaeda.

Question 14: And what about possible future provocations like that, because our President Putin has said that there's information that such kind of provocations could happen in the future. What is your assessment of this possibility?

President Assad: Actually, this possibility is not only because of what happened recently. It happened before, and we had this possibility a few years ago, since the first time they used it in 2013, since that time it's a possibility for us, and it's been used, it wasn't only a possibility, but this time the propaganda was different, because everybody was ready for the attack, so that was part of the agenda, part of the plan, it was one plan, it wasn't two different incidents. So, of course it is a possibility. This is first, I mean because it happened before.
Second, because the regime in the United States hasn't changed. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has been attacking different countries in different ways without taking into consideration the Security Council or the United Nations. So, the deep regime hasn't changed, the deep regime is the same that go and attack and kill and tell lies in order to justify what you are doing or what you have been doing. So, nothing has changed regarding the United States. They can do it any time, they can do something different, because their aim is to destabilize Syria, their aim is to change the government, to topple the government, and to bring their puppets instead, so they will do everything, for them the end justifies the means, no values, no morals at all, anything could happen.

Question 15: And is there a threat of using of chemical weapons by the terrorists? And if so, from where do they get it? From which countries?

President Assad: From Turkey. Directly from Turkey, and there was evidences regarding this, some of them have been shown on the internet a few years ago. You had many parties and parliament members in Turkey who questioned the government regarding those allegations. So, it's not something hidden. Many in Syria knew that, and the only way, the only route for the terrorists to get money, armaments, every logistic support, recruits, and this kind of material, is through Turkey, they don't have any other way to come from the north. So, it's a hundred percent Turkey.

Question 16: Let's go to another point about the military situation. When will the Syrian Army start an operation to liberate Raqqa, and will the Kurdish units be involved, and will Russians be involved, and is there a possibility of cooperation with the Western coalition and Iraqi forces?

President Assad: Regarding fighting terrorism, we always announce that we are ready to cooperate with any country who is genuinely ready or wants or has the will to fight terrorism. We didn't even define which countries; any country including the West, taking into consideration that we already know that the West supports the terrorists and it doesn't have a will to fight them. But we said whoever is ready, we are ready. Regarding the Syrian-Russian cooperation and talking about the Kurds, we always talk with different factions in Syria who are fighting the terrorists, and we had direct contact with the Kurds, and of course with the Russians regarding this. The question on how, you know that only a month ago our army was advancing from Aleppo towards the east, toward Raqqa, it wasn't far from reaching Raqqa, and this is when the terrorists launched their attack against the middle of Syria, against the city of Hama, in order to protect ISIS in two areas: the eastern area is Hama, which is close to Palmyra after we liberated Palmyra recently, in order to slow the advance of the Syrian Army in that direction. The second one is toward Raqqa for the same objective. And actually because of that attack on Hama we had to slow down our attack – not stop it, to slow down – because part of the troops, Syrian Arab Army troops, in both directions have to come south and west to Hama in order to defend the city, and of course they repelled the attack and they succeeded, but at the expense of advancing in different areas. So, that will tell you about the relation between ISIS and al-Nusra, and the relation between ISIS and al-Nusra and Turkey, and of course Turkey means the United States, and the United States means France and the UK, and both mean Saudi Arabia, and so on. So, this is one choir actually, and they have one army, one proxy army, which is different factions, mainly Al Qaeda, mainly al-Nusra and ISIS. So, that's why our advancement toward Raqqa has been slowed down, because we changed the priority because of different fronts of the terrorists.

Question 17: I see. And regarding Turkey, you've mentioned, so in the north of Aleppo, in al-Bab, the Syrian Army is facing Turkey forces that have invaded Syria in breach of international law. Will the Syrian Army undertake any action to put an end to this Turkish intervention, and so when and how this could take place?

President Assad: When you talk about the Turkish invasion, when you talk about the American troops – again, it's an invasion – and when you talk about the terrorists on the ground, it's one entity, there's no difference. There's one master who's controlling all these factions. So, the priority now is to defeat the terrorists. When you defeat the terrorists, the Turkish army and any other army will be weak on the ground. Their real strength are their proxies, not their own army. In that regard, when you defeat the terrorists in different areas, it's going to be very easy to expel any other one including the Turks; either they leave, or it's your land, you have to defend it, you have to go and fight, you can't say ""they can stay"" or ""let's negotiate."" No, you don't negotiate; it's your land, you defend it, you expel them, you fight them. But the priority now is to fight their proxies, because they are the strongest element on the ground.

Question 18: And do you expect military escalation after the US missile strike, and can this result lead to direct confrontation between Syria and the United States?

President Assad: Actually, as you know, they attacked the airbase from the Mediterranean, so you're talking about hundreds of miles, sometimes thousands of miles away, which is out of our reach as Syrian Army. So, if we want to be realistic, we can say we don't reach their ships in the Mediterranean, but if you talk about the troops on the ground, again, the same like the Turkish issue, when you defeat their terrorists – because the terrorists are their terrorists – this is where you can go and fight others who occupy the land. In that regard, the Americans, like the Turks, like any other occupiers, they have to get out by their will or by force.

Question 19: Do you think that there can be an improvement in the bilateral relations between Syria and the United States?

President Assad: We always try to look at the full half of the cup, but we couldn't find it. We tried to see anything positive, we said that what this president, Trump, what he said, we said ""promising,"" I described it as promising, a few months ago. But actually, it's not about what they promise, because we all know that the American officials say something and do something different, they're never committed to their promises or their words. So, that's what have been proven recently after the attack on Shairat; they say something and they do something different. So, in politics you don't say ""I wouldn't do this."" Whenever there is a window of hope that this state or this regime can change its attitude toward respecting your sovereignty, toward more preventing of any blood-letting in your country, you have to cooperate. It's not a personal relation, it's not hate and love; it's the interest of your own people. So, I cannot say this escalation has changed anything, because this escalation is the real expression of the reality of the American regime that's been there for decades, it's not new for the United States to do such a thing, but you need to deal with the United States as a great country, at least to make it refrain from any harmful effects, generally, I'm not talking only about Syria. When they change their behavior, we are ready, we don't have a problem.

Question 20: Have you tried to establish any contacts, or do you plan to have contacts with representatives of the Trump administration?

President Assad: Not really, we don't have any channel now between Syria and the United States regime or administration, we don't have.

Question 21: Okay, and how do you assess the emerging coalition between the United States and Kurdish units? Have you taken steps to prevent the establishment of self-ruling region in the north of the country?

President Assad: We don't have control in that area, in the meantime, but talking about self-control or confederation or anything like this, when you don't have war, when you have a normal situation, it's going to be related to the constitution, because Syria is a melting pot of different cultures, different ethnicities, religions, sects, and so on. So, not a single part of this social fabric can define the future of Syria; it needs consensus. So, regarding what you mentioned, it's better to wait to discuss the next constitution between the different Syrian shades of our spectrum, let's say, and this is where we can tell how's it going to be there. Our impression today is that the majority, the vast majority of Syrians, never believe in self-governance or confederation or anything. In this time, it's being used as an excuse because there's no government in that area. They say ""we are governing ourselves because there is no government."" It's an excuse for today, but when you have stability and the government taking control of the country, of course there's no excuse to deal with such a situation unless there's a constitution that allows a certain area to have its confederation or federation or any other way of governance.

Question 22: And regarding the constitution, have you already started the project that is now debated in Geneva, and what do you think about the proposal of withdrawing the word ""Arab"" from the name of the country?

President Assad: Again, as a government, we don't own the constitution; it should a Syrian consensus. If the Syrians don't believe in the word of ""Arab state,"" what's the meaning of having this word? Just because the government believes? No, we have to be the mirror of the majority of the Syrians, when we say yes or no. Our impression is that the majority of the Syrians, they adhere to this word, because this is their identity, the majority of Syrians are Arabs, and they believe in their identity. But again, I wouldn't say that this is right or wrong till the Syrians have their own say in a referendum, before saying the President said he supports this word or he's against that word. It means nothing in the meantime. It's still early to discuss that point, it's not a contention issue, I mean, nobody is discussing it now. A few people in Syria, mainly among the Kurds, mention this issue. It's not a big problem.

Question 23: And what is the most contentious issue, according to you?

President Assad: To the constitution?

Journalist: To the constitution, yes.

President Assad: Being secular. Most of the factions that apparently joined the negotiations in Astana and part of them in Geneva, they don't accept a secular state, they want it a religious state, Islamic state. This is the most important part of, could be, the disagreement regarding the constitution. Of course till this moment we haven't started direct negotiations, but we know through the mediators what they propose, and what we propose.

Question 24: So, we just talked about the situation in the north, and something is happening there down in the south. So, do you have any information about Jordan's plans to deploy its troops in Syria in coordination with the United States under the pretext of fighting ISIS? Certain media reported. And if this is the case, do you think that there is a threat from the neighboring countries to dismember Syria?
President Assad: We have those information, not only through the media, through the different sources, because you know we have the same tribes, the same families living on both sides of the borders, so they can see any changes in the mood or in the logistics, any new plans of the army you can see it on the ground. So, we have such information, but anyway Jordan was part of the American plan since the beginning of the war in Syria. Whether he likes it or not, he has to obey the orders of the Americans. Jordan is not an independent country anyway, whatever the American wants, it will happen, so if the Americans want to use the northern part of Jordan against Syria, they're going to use it, so it's not about Jordan, we don't discuss Jordan as a state; we discuss Jordan as land in that case, because it's the United States who defines the plans, who defines the players, and who endorses everything regarding Syria coming from Jordan, and many of the terrorists coming from Jordan, and of course Turkey, since day one of the war in Syria.

Question 25: Let's talk a little bit about the situation in Mosul. What is your estimate of the number of ISIS militants pushed out of the Mosul region into the Syrian territory? And to what extent did the coalition's operation in Mosul and the withdrawal of terrorists strengthen the positions of ISIS here in Syria? Could this, for instance, lead to the full terrorist control over Deir Ezzor?

President Assad: If we want to link different events with each other, we can have the answer. First of all, no-one has a precise number of ISIS coming to Syria because it's a free border now; you don't have regular borders, you don't have Syrian Army, you don't have police, you have no state there. So, no-one can tell you, but the estimation from the information that we have from the citizens in those areas, they talk about tens of thousands of fighters of ISIS coming to Syria. If you go back a few months ago when the alliance airplanes attacked our military site beside Deir Ezzor, they attacked one of the major sites, it's a mountain called Thurda, which is a strategic mountain to protect Deir Ezzor from being in the hands of ISIS. They attacked our army for more than one hour, and they killed tens of our soldiers, and they said ""sorry, it was a mistake,"" although it is a big mountain, a huge mountain; you cannot make a mistake, it's not a building. Then later, they started allowing the fighters coming from Mosul. Of course, they wanted to do a two-aspect operation. The first aspect is that the United States is attacking ISIS in Mosul, they are against ISIS, but at the same time, they are supporting ISIS and they allow them to cross the border from Iraq into Syria. It means they helped ISIS to come to Deir Ezzor and to undermine the Syrian Army who are defending Deir Ezzor. They wanted Deir Ezoor to fall into the hands of ISIS and maybe later in one of their plays like what happened in Jarablus, in Ein al-Arab, in different areas, they will make negotiations with ISIS to leave Deir Ezzor and to say that they liberated Deir Ezzor to send their proxies and puppets to attack them. Fortunately, the Syrian Army was resilient and strong enough to repel ISIS after the alliance attack a few months ago. Now, it's advancing slowly, recapturing the area from ISIS slowly, but the situation today is better than yesterday and better than a week ago, and so on. So, your question is a hundred percent correct. That's an American plan, and they allow them and they give them the cover to come to Syria.

Question 26: So, it changes the situation, the military situation as you said, the threats from the north, from the Iraqi part of the borders, from Jordan, and the military missile attack from US ships. In this situation, are you going to ask Russia for more help to enhance the Russian assistance, including probably on the ground?

President Assad: Actually, the Russian air forces were very effective and efficient during the last year and a half, little bit more, in supporting the Syrian Army, and everybody knows that since that support started in 2015, the balance has changed, and we could recapture Palmyra and Aleppo and many other areas, and we could defend Hama recently; it was a very huge and well-organized attack, but we could repel it. So, that support was very efficient, and of course, we shouldn't forget the efficient support of the Iranians on the ground; they did not send troops, but with their officers, with their advisors, they played a very important role. So, I don't think now there is a need for ground troops. Sometimes when there is intense attack on different fronts, as you mentioned, north, east, south, and in the middle, the Russian missiles attack from the sea. The Russian strategic bomber came from Russia to attack in Syria. So, the military support, the Russian military support is not limited to their base in Syria. Actually, they are aware about what the need of the fight; you have this fluctuation, but you don't need troops on the ground till that moment. Maybe in the future if our enemies and their supporters, their terrorists, the proxies, change their strategy and bring more terrorists from around the world, and you have full armies of terrorists at that time, it could be needed, but at this moment, I don't think it's needed. What's been done is good and enough.

Question 27: Regarding the future of the political settlement, how do you see it, taking into account the low effectiveness of the Geneva talks? And can Astana replace Geneva as a main platform for negotiations? And another question: are there any people with whom you are ready to contact, to engage in direct talks from the opposition side, I mean from those who come to Astana, from the military factions, or in Geneva?

President Assad: First of all, our estimation of Geneva is that it hasn't started yet; till this moment, nothing, it's a still-born, it's dead, because, I mean if you want to buy utility in the market, the first you read on the box is the requirement, what's the requirement for this utility to work properly, to deliver what you expect? The same for anything in this world. If you are talking about Geneva, it could be a good idea. Astana is a very good idea, but do we have the requirement for these two means to produce? Till the moment, no, because part of this event which is Russia, Iran, and of course Syria, they are willing to achieve a peaceful solution. They respect the sovereignty of Syria, they're looking for the unity of Syria, they respect the Charter of the United Nations, the different Security Council resolutions, and so on, while if you look at the other party, the Western bloc with their allies in the region and their proxies, of course, they are in the other side. They are using these events only as a political umbrella for the terrorists, not for the political solution. So, the requirement is that to have one objective. Now, you don't have one objective; you have different objectives, you have at least two objectives. You need to discuss it with the other side, let's call them opposition, whether they are militants or political opposition, but they are different factions and they have different points of views. So, you are not talking about one entity. So, many of the requirements haven't been provided yet in order for these initiatives to succeed till this moment. Now, are we ready to sit? Of course, in Syria we sat with the terrorists, and how can we make those reconciliations if we don't sit with them? From the very beginning, we noted that there was no real and genuine political track for the reason that I just mentioned. So, I said let's go and pave the way for your own political track, which is direct negotiations with the terrorists or militants in different areas, and tell them if you give up your armaments, I will give you amnesty and you go back to your normal life, live normally like any other citizen. Otherwise, if you are not part of this reconciliation, you can leave anywhere you want, and that's what's happening today and yesterday and every day, that's happening from time to time, and that helped the stability in many areas in Syria, and that undermined the terrorists and their masters. So, yes, we are ready to sit with whoever could help us in stopping this blood-shedding in Syria, whoever, we don't have any problem, we don't have any taboo in that regard.

Question 28: But you don't have any preferences as well?

President Assad: In what way, what do you mean?

Journalist: In the way of having some concrete people, concrete names, with whom the Syrian government can talk directly?

President Assad: No, sometimes, you can say I'm going to sit with political opposition, I wouldn't sit with the militants, let's say. I would sit with the opposition that's not linked to Qatar or to Saudi Arabia or to France, and so on. It's not part of the foreigner or foreign agenda against Syria, but at the end, the main question that you are going to ask before starting any negotiation: is he able to deliver? What can he do? If I sit with somebody who doesn't have any influence on the ground, on the reality in Syria, what are we going to agree upon? It's just a waste of time. So, actually we are very pragmatic in that regard; we say let's sit with whoever can change the situation in two ways. The first one is to stop the killing, this is number one, this is a priority for every Syrian, not for the government; every Syrian. If you ask anyone, he'll tell you we need security, we need stability, this is number one. Second, if you want to discuss it politically, you can talk about anything. You can talk about the constitution, the future of Syria, the political system that you want, the economic system; anything is going to be viable. It won't be complicated that time, but without stability, you cannot achieve anything in any negotiation. That's why I said, we went directly to talk to the militants, that is not our preference, as your question, but it's the most effective in the meantime.

Question 29: You've mentioned Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and recently Kazakhstan as a host country of Astana process invited… not invited, but proposed to invite more countries to this process, including Qatar and the Saudis, how do you think about that?

President Assad: I think the more countries you have, the better, in different ways; you either have more support to this initiative and that will protect that initiative and raise the possibility of success, or you have the same countries that they are going to oppose it whether they are part of it or outside. But if they are part of it, you can point at them, you can tell them that you're part of the problem and you have to help, and if you are genuine about helping, not only by your discourse and rhetoric, this is the initiative, be part of it and show us that you are against the terrorism, show us that you support what the Syrian people want. So, in both ways, it's positive to invite whoever wants to come. So, I support what the Kazakhstani officials announced yesterday about expanding the participation in Astana.

Question 30: Recently, the foreign ministers of Russia, Syria, and Iran assessed their talks in Moscow as a success. Would you like to build on this success and hold that trilateral meeting on a presidential level?

President Assad: It's not about the level, what they expressed in their statements, their views, it represents their presidents, because the minister of foreign affairs, he works with the president anyway. So, it's not about which level, because whoever talks, any official, represents the whole government, the whole state. Maybe if there is a necessity in the future to do it, of course it's a good idea, but for us in Syria, now the priority is to reach the objective. It's not about the formalities, let' say.

Question 31: Let's talk a little bit about the bilateral relations in the economic filed. So, recently, our Vice Prime Minster Dmitry Rogozin has visited Damascus and he said that there was an agreement to promote Russian companies in Syria, and that he received guarantees from you that Russian companies will be well-received and have priorities here. So, what are the specific mechanisms that were established to fulfill this purpose?

President Assad: We have our laws regarding how to make contracts with the different companies. We already started with some of the companies after his visit, especially as the Western companies left Syria, not because of the security situation, not for security reasons, actually for political reasons. So, if we want to call it market, the Syrian market is free now for Russian companies to come and join and to play an important part in rebuilding Syria and investing in Syria. The most important part for me, and I think for them as well, is the oil field, the oil and gas, and some Russian companies now joined, let's say, that sector recently during the last few months, and the process of signing the contracts, the final, let's say, steps of signing the contracts is underway. So, that's how I look at it.

Journalist: Alright Mr. President. Thanks a lot for this interview. It was very frank and very interesting. Thank you very much.

President Assad: Thank you for coming.

""When the blast rocked the area, people rushed into the woods but militants surrounded them and forced back to the buses,"" the bus driver said.

A female evacuee recalled that ""the militants told us that terrorists from another group were shelling our buses and that we must flee towards the bushes… but then they said that the bushes were mined and found ourselves trapped.""

Another woman also told Beeley that even before the explosion, four yellow Turkish ambulances were present at the scene for some reason. After the blast, the ambulances started picking up the dead and injured, only to take them to an unknown location.

""We don't know where they [the children] are. They're gone. There are no bodies. We've searched for them, but with no result,"" one of the witnesses said.

Many relatives of those missing still know nothing of their whereabouts, other witnesses said. Some people told Beeley that the controversial White Helmets were also seen at the blast site, retrieving bodies of Al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham militants, but apparently leaving injured civilians.

Beeley, who has consistently covered the Syrian war, also filmed people's testimonies about their escape from the rebel-held areas. The evacuees boarded the buses on Friday in the Rashideen neighborhood of Aleppo, but were not allowed out of the vehicles for nearly three days.

Many of them, however, were happy to leave as ""this place turned into a terrorists' hotbed,"" one woman said.

Beeley told RT that not many in the West followed the UN's example in decrying the attack.

""We've just witnessed one of the most heinous crimes of our lifetime, and yet corporate… there's no international condemnation from governments, from NGOs, from the media,"" she said.

On the contrary, the media is making an attempt to ""whitewash this utterly abhorrent"" incident, in which, according to Beeley's information, 116 children lost their lives.

""It happened when a vehicle loaded with food arrived and started distributing crisps, attracting many children, before exploding, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Lina Sinjab said. She said it was not clear how the vehicle could have reached the area without government permission. But there is also no evidence that rebels were involved in the attack, as the government claims. 
It would not be in the rebels' interest, our correspondent says, as they were waiting for their own supporters to be evacuated from the other towns.""

Excerpt from Pres #Assad's interview with #AFP

Question 4: So you think it's a fabrication? (referring to the chemical attack)

President Assad: Definitely, a hundred percent for us, it's fabrication. We don't have an arsenal, we're not going to use it. And you have many indications if you don't have proof, because no-one has concrete information or evidences, but you have indications. For example, less than two weeks, around ten days before that attack, the terrorists were advancing in many fronts, including the suburbs of Damascus and Hama which is not far from Khan Sheikhoun, let's suppose we have this arsenal, and let's suppose that we have the will to use it, why didn't we use it when we were retreating and the terrorists were advancing? Actually, the timing of that attack or alleged attack was when the Syrian Army was advancing very fast, and actually the terrorists were collapsing. So, why to use it, if you have it and if you have the will, why to use it at that timing, not when you were in a difficult situation, logically? This is first.

Second, if you want to use it, if you have it and if you want to use it – again, this is if we suppose – why to use it against civilians, not to use it against the terrorists that we are fighting? Third, in that area, we don't have army, we don't have battles, we don't have any, let's say, object in Khan Sheikhoun, and it's not a strategic area. Why to attack it? What's the reason? Militarily, I'm talking from a military point of view. Of course, the foundation for us, morally, we wouldn't do it if we have it, we wouldn't have the will, because morally this is not acceptable. We won't have the support of the public. So, every indication is against the whole story, so you can say that this play that they staged doesn't hold together. The story is not convincing by any means.

'#KhanSheikhoun incident totally fabricated..the US is not serious in achieving any political solution'

13 April، 2017

President Bashar al-Assad gave an interview to AFP in which he said what happened in Khan Shaikhoun is a fabricated story, stressing that Syria does not possess a chemical arsenal and that even if it has such an arsenal, it will not use it.

He made it clear that Syria can only allow any investigation in the Khan Sheikhoun incident when it's impartial.

Following is the full text of the interview;

Question 1: Mr. President, first I want to thank you very much to receive me for an interview. Mr. President, did you give an order to strike Khan Sheikhoun with chemical weapons last Tuesday?

President Assad: Actually, no-one has investigated what happened that day in Khan Sheikhoun till the moment. As you know, Khan Sheikhoun is under the control of al-Nusra Front, which is a branch of Al Qaeda, so the only information the world have had till this moment is published by Al Qaeda branch. No-one has any other information. We don't know if the whole pictures or videos that we've been seeing are true or fabricated. That's why we asked for investigation to what happened in Khan Sheikhoun. This is first.

Second, Al Qaeda sources said that the attack happened at 6, 6:30 in the morning, while the Syrian attack in the same area was around noon, between 11:30 to 12. So, they're talking about two different stories or events. So, there was no order to make any attack, we don't have any chemical weapons, we gave up our arsenal a few years ago. Even if we have them, we wouldn't use them, and we have never used our chemical arsenal in our history.

Question 2: So what happened this day?

President Assad: As I said, the only source is Al Qaeda, we cannot take it seriously. But our impression is that the West, mainly the United States, is hand in glove with the terrorists. They fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack, It wasn't an attack because of what happened in khan Sheikhoun. It's one event, its stage one is the play that we saw on the social networking and on TVs, and the propaganda, and the stage two is the military attack. That's what we believe is happening because it's only few days – two days, 48 hours – between the play and the attacks, and no investigations, no concrete evidence about anything, the only thing were allegations and propaganda, and then strike.

Question 3: So, who according to you is responsible about this alleged chemical attack?

President Assad: The allegation itself was by Al Qaeda, al-Nusra Front, so we don't have to investigate who, they announced it, it's under their control, no-one else. About the attack, as I said, it's not clear whether it happened or not, because how can you verify a video? You have a lot of fake videos now, and you have the proof that those videos were fake, like the White Helmets for example, they are Al Qaeda, they are al-Nusra Front who shaved their beards, wore white hats, and appeared as humanitarian heroes, which is not the case. The same people were killing Syrian soldiers, and you have the proof on the internet anyway. So, the same thing for that chemical attack, we don't know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun? Were they dead at all? Who committed the attack if there was an attack? What's the material? You have no information at all, nothing at all, no-one investigated.

Question 4: So you think it's a fabrication?

President Assad: Definitely, a hundred percent for us, it's fabrication. We don't have an arsenal, we're not going to use it. And you have many indications if you don't have proof, because no-one has concrete information or evidences, but you have indications. For example, less than two weeks, around ten days before that attack, the terrorists were advancing in many fronts, including the suburbs of Damascus and Hama which is not far from Khan Sheikhoun, let's suppose we have this arsenal, and let's suppose that we have the will to use it, why didn't we use it when we were retreating and the terrorists were advancing? Actually, the timing of that attack or alleged attack was when the Syrian Army was advancing very fast, and actually the terrorists were collapsing. So, why to use it, if you have it and if you have the will, why to use it at that timing, not when you were in a difficult situation, logically? This is first.

Second, if you want to use it, if you have it and if you want to use it – again, this is if we suppose – why to use it against civilians, not to use it against the terrorists that we are fighting? Third, in that area, we don't have army, we don't have battles, we don't have any, let's say, object in Khan Sheikhoun, and it's not a strategic area. Why to attack it? What's the reason? Militarily, I'm talking from a military point of view. Of course, the foundation for us, morally, we wouldn't do it if we have it, we wouldn't have the will, because morally this is not acceptable. We won't have the support of the public. So, every indication is against the whole story, so you can say that this play that they staged doesn't hold together. The story is not convincing by any means.

Question 5: With the US airstrike, Trump seems to have changed his position on you and Syria drastically. Do you have the feeling that you lost what you have called a potential partner?

President Assad: I said ""if"". It was conditional. If they are serious in fighting terrorists, we're going to be partners, and I said not only the United States; whoever wants to fight the terrorists, we are partners. This is basic for us, basic principle, let's say. Actually, what has been proven recently, as I said earlier, that they are hand in glove with those terrorists, the United States and the West, they're not serious in fighting the terrorists, and yesterday some of their statesmen were defending ISIS. They were saying that ISIS doesn't have chemical weapons. They are defending ISIS against the Syrian government and the Syrian Army. So, actually, you cannot talk about partnership between us who work against the terrorists and who fight the terrorism and the others who are supporting explicitly the terrorists.

Question 6: So, can we say that the US strike changed your opinion on Trump?

President Assad: Anyway, I was very cautious in saying any opinion regarding him before he became President and after. I always say let's see what he's going to do, we wouldn't comment on statements. So, actually, this is the first proof that it's not about the President in the United State; it's about the regime and the deep state or the deep regime in the United States is still the same, it doesn't change. The President is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every President there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he's going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree U-turn, otherwise he would pay the price politically.

Question 7: But do you think that there will be another attack?

President Assad: As long as the United States is being governed by this complex of military industrial complex, the financial companies, banks, and what you call deep regime, and works for the vested interest of those groups, of course. It could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria.

Question 8: And, your army or the Russians will retaliate if it happens again?

President Assad: Actually, if you want to talk about retaliation, we are talking about missiles coming from hundreds of miles, which is out of our reach, but actually the real war in Syria is not about those missiles; it's about supporting the terrorists. This is the most dangerous part of this war, and our response is going to be what we started from the very first day: is smashing the terrorists everywhere in Syria. When we get rid of the terrorists, we wouldn't worry about anything else at that time. So, this is our response. It's a response, not reaction.

Question 9: So, what you say means that retaliation by the Syrian Army or by the Russians will be very difficult, because the boats are very far?

President Assad: For us, as a small country, yeah, of course it is, everybody knows that. It's out of reach. I mean, they can have missiles from another continent. We all know that. They are a great power, we're not a great power. Talking about the Russians, this is another issue.

Question 10: Would you accept the findings of OPCW investigation?

President Assad: Since the very first time, when we had in 2013, I think, the first attacks by the terrorists on the Syrian Army by chemical missiles at that time, we asked for investigation. We were the ones who asked for investigations every time there was chemical attacks or allegations about chemical attacks. We asked. And this time, we were discussing with the Russians yesterday and during the last few days after the strike that we're going to work with them on international investigation. But it should be impartial. We can only allow any investigation when it's impartial, when we make sure that unbiased countries will participate in this delegation in order to make sure that they won't use it for politicized purposes.

Question 11: And, if they accuse the government, would you step down?

President Assad: If they accuse, or if they prove? There's a big difference. No, they are already accusing the government, and if you mean by ""them"" the West, no, we don't care about the West. If you mean the chemical agency, if they can prove that there's an attack, we have to investigate who gave the order to that attack. But a hundred percent, as Syrian Army, we don't have, and we cannot – even if we want, we cannot – we don't have the means to commit such attack, and we don't have the will.

Question 12: So, you mean that you don't have chemical weapons?

President Assad: No, no, definitely, a few years ago, in 2013, we gave up all our arsenal, and the chemical agency announced that Syria is free of any chemical materials.

Question 13: Because the Pentagon said that there are chemical weapons in the airbase, you deny it?

President Assad: They attacked that airbase, and they destroyed the depots of different materials, and there was no sarin gas. How? If they said that we launched the sarin attack from that airbase, what happened to the sarin when they attacked the depots? Did we hear about any sarin? Our Chief of Staff was there a few hours later, how could he go there if there was sarin gas? How could you only have six martyrs if you have hundreds of soldiers and officers working there, but there was sarin, and they didn't die. The same fabricated videos that we've been seeing about Khan Sheikhoun, when the rescuers tried to rescue the victims or the supposedly dead people or inflicted people, but actually they weren't wearing any masks or any gloves. How? Where's the sarin? They should be affected, right away. So, this is all allegation. I mean, this attack and these allegations is another proof that it was fabricated and there was no sarin anywhere.

Question 14: If you say that you didn't give any order, it is possible that the chemical attack could have been carried out by a rogue or fringe element from the army?

President Assad: Even if you have a rogue element, the army doesn't have chemical materials. This is first. Second, a rogue army cannot send an airplane at their will, even if they want. It's an airplane, it's not a small car to take it from place to place or a small machinegun to use it. You can talk about somebody who has been using his pistol on his behalf the way he wants and break the law, that could happen anywhere in the world, but not an airplane. This is second.

Third, the Syrian Army is a regular army, it's not a militia. It's a regular army, it has hierarchy, it has very clear way of orders, so this kind of ""rough personnel tried to do something against the will of the leadership of the army"" never happened during the last six years of the war in Syria.

Question 15: Did the Russians warn you before the US attack? And were they present in the airbase?

President Assad: No, they didn't warn us because they didn't have the time to warn, because the Americans called them maybe a few minutes before the launching, or some say after the launching, because it takes time to reach the base. But actually, we had indications that there was something that was going to happen, and we took many measures in that regard.

Question 16: Do you confirm that 20% of your air force has been destroyed in this attack as the Americans said?

President Assad: I don't know what's the criteria, what's the reference of 20%, what's the hundred percent for them? Is it the number of airplanes? Is it the quality? Is it, how to say, the active airplanes and stored airplanes? I don't know what do they mean by this. No, actually, what we and the Russians announced about a few airplanes being destroyed, most of them are the old ones, some of them were not active anyway. This is the reality, and the proof is that, since the strike, we haven't stopped attacking terrorists all over Syria. So, we didn't feel that we are really affected. Our firepower, our ability to attack the terrorists hasn't been affected by this strike.

Question 17: You know, your government said in the beginning that you hit a chemical weapon depot. Is it true?

President Assad: It was a possibility, because when you attack any target related to the terrorists, you don't know what's in it. You know that this a target; it could be a store, it could be warehouse, it could be a depot, it could be a camp, it could be a headquarter, we don't know. But you know that the terrorists are using this place and you attack it, like any other place, and that's what we've been doing since the beginning of the war on daily bases, on hourly bases sometimes, but you cannot tell what's within this. So, that was one of the possibilities that the airstrikes attacked a depot of chemical materials, but this is conflicting again with the timing of the announcement, not because only the terrorists announced it in the morning, but because their media, their pages on Twitter and on the internet announced the attack a few hours before the alleged one, which is 4 in the mourning. 4 in the morning, they announced that there's going to be a chemical attack, we have to be ready. How did they know about it?

Question 18: Don't you see that Khan Sheikhoun is a huge setback for you? For the first time in six years, the US attack your army and yesterday after a brief honeymoon, yesterday Tillerson said that reign of Assad family is coming to the end, don't you think that Khan Sheikhoun is a huge setback for you?

President Assad: There is no reign of Assad family anyway in Syria. He's dreaming, or let's say, he's hallucinating, so, we don't waste our time with his statement. In reality, no. Actually, during the last six years, The US was directly involved in supporting the terrorists everywhere in Syria, including ISIS, including al-Nusra, including all the other like-minded factions in Syria, this is clear, and this is proven in Syria. While if you want to talk about the direct attacks, actually only a few months ago, there was a more dangerous attack than the recent one, just before Obama left, I think a few weeks before he left, it was in Deir Ezzor in the eastern part of Syria when they attacked a very strategic mountain, it was a Syrian base, a regular Syrian Army base, and that helped ISIS to take over that mountain, and if the Syrian Army wasn't resilient and strong enough to repel ISIS, the city of Deir Ezzor would have been now in the hands of ISIS, means a direct link between Deir Ezzor and Mosul in Iraq, which would have been a very strategic gain to ISIS. So, actually, no, the American government was directly involved. But this time, why did they attack directly? Because, as I said, the terrorists in that area were collapsing. So, the Unites States didn't have any other choice to support their proxies, the terrorists, but to directly attack the Syrian Army because they sent them all kinds of armaments and it didn't work.

Question 19: So, for you, it's not a huge setback?

President Assad: No, no, it's actually part of the context, the same context for six years; it took different shapes, but the core of the American policy and the Western policy towards what's happening in Syria, it hasn't changed at all. Forget about the statements; sometimes we have high-pitch statements, sometimes you have low-pitch statements, but it's the same policy.

Question 20: You have gradually pushed most of the rebels into Idleb, do you plan to attack it next?

President Assad: We're going to attack terrorists anywhere in Syria, Idleb or any other place. What's the timing, what's the priority, this is a military issue and should be discussed on the military level.

Question 21: You said before that Raqqa is a priority for your government, but the forces advancing on the city are mostly US-backed Kurds, aren't you afraid of being excluded from the liberation of Raqqa?

President Assad: No, we support whoever wants to liberate any city from the terrorists, but that doesn't mean to be liberated from terrorists and being occupied by American forces, for example, or by another proxy, or another terrorists. So, it's not clear who is going to liberate Raqqa. Is it really Syrian forces that are going to hand it over to the Syrian Army? Is it going to be in cooperation with the Syrian Army? It's not clear yet. But what we hear is only allegations about liberating Raqqa. We've been hearing that for nearly a year now, or less than a year, but nothing happened on the ground. So, it's just, let's say, a hypothetical question, because there is nothing concrete on the ground.

Question 22: The US and Russia are the co-sponsors of Geneva process. Because of the tension between the two countries, do you think that this process can continue?

President Assad: Look, there's a big difference between the process being active, which could happen anytime, to reactivate the process and to be effective. Till this moment, its' not effective. Why? Because the United States is not serious in achieving any political solution. They want to use it as an umbrella for the terrorists, or they want to get in this forum what they didn't get on the ground in the battlefield. That's why it wasn't effective at all. Now, it's the same situation, we don't see this administration serious in that regard, because they still support the same terrorists. So, we can say yes, it could be reactivated, but we cannot say we expect it to be effective or productive. No.

Question 23: After six years, Mr. President, aren't you tired?

President Assad: Actually, the only thing that could make pressure on you is not the political situation, not the military situation; actually the human situation in Syria, the daily blood-letting, the daily blood-shedding, the suffering and the hardship that inflicted every house in Syria, this is the only painful thing that could make you feel tired- if it is accurate to say ""tired""- while if you talk about the war, about the politics, about the relation with the West, no, I don't feel tired at all, because we are defending our country, and we're not going to get tired at all in that regard.

Question 24: What makes you lose sleep?

President Assad: Again, the suffering of the Syrian people. The humanitarian interaction between me and every Syrian family directly or indirectly, this is the only thing that could deprive me from sleep from time to time, but not the Western statements and not the threat of the support of the terrorists.

Question 25: Today, there are people from Foua'a and Kefraya who will move from their village to Damascus and to Aleppo. You are not afraid that in fact it will be a displacement of population, that the Syria after the war will not be the same Syria as before?

President Assad: The displacement in that context is compulsory. We didn't choose it. We wish that everyone could stay in his village and his city, but those people like many other civilians in different areas were surrounded and besieged by the terrorists, and they've been killed on daily basis, so they had to leave. But of course they're going to go back to their cities after the liberation; that happened in many other areas where the people are going back to their homes. So, it's temporary. Talking about demographic changes is not in the sake or in the interest of the Syrian society when it's permanent. As long as it's temporary, we wouldn't worry about it.

Journalist: Mr. President, I want to thank you very much for this interview.

President Assad: Thank you.

Journalist: It was very interesting, and thank you very much for talking with me.

President Assad: Thank you.

On Thursday April 6, the United States launched scores of Tomahawk cruise missiles into the Shayrat air base in Syria. In the process the ""precision"" missiles that missed the base killed 9 civilians in nearby villages. This unprovoked attack is a dramatic and dangerous escalation of the war in Syria and an assault on the sovereignty of the Syrian people.

Donald Trump has justified the order by claiming ""vital reasons of national security"". After the attack he made a call to all ""civilized Western Nations"" to join the U.S. to ""end the killing and bloodshed in Syria"". This coming from the same president that just last week was bombarding Mosul killing hundreds of civilians in a single attack and who on March 21 bombed a school in the Syrian village of al Mansoura killing 33 men, women and children who were seeking shelter there.

It should also be remembered that for the last 6 years Syria has been under attack by scores of terrorist groups that are supported and financed by the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and various Western nations, with the objective of regime change and taking away Syria's independence and splitting it into pieces.

The attack yesterday comes just two days after the Syrian Government categorically rejected the use of chemical weapons in Idleb. The lack of proof and the imperial manipulation of those facts by the Trump administration and the demonization of the Syrian Government through the corporate media is an attempt to gain consent of public opinion to escalate military intervention under the false notion they are doing it out of humanitarian concerns for the Syrian people. If the U.S. was so concerned about the people of the Middle East it would end their support for the systematic occupation of Palestine and call for the freedom of the detained and tortured Palestinian children that are filling Israeli jails.

This is the same script they used in Iraq and Libya, where chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction were never found. The history of U.S. interventions is littered with false pretexts in order to control and seize the resources of countries not aligned with their interests.

These are the same imperial hegemonic interests that are now targeting Bolivarian Venezuela to overthrow President Maduro and that continue the genocidal blockade against Cuba. In the case of Venezuela they are using the Organization of American States (OAS), led by Luis Almagro, as a battering ram to overthrow a popular, democratically elected government. The methods may be different than in Syria but the desired results are the same.

Once again we call for solidarity with the people of Syria and all oppressed people.

""It's very telling that #Trump was able to rally 63% of Americans behind him in his aggression against #Syria while  61% of Americans opposed Obama's intent to launch strikes in 2013. This huge discrepancy exists despite the unprecedented level of opposition to Trump, with the very legitimacy of his presidency questioned, and despite the complete lack of evidence contained in the White House Intelligence Report on the chemical attack, and despite the absence of a UN investigation, and despite Trump's morally deranged antics such as bragging that he was ""eating a beautiful chocolate cake"" when he was informed about the strikes, outdoing Marie Antoinette's ""let them eat cake"" dictum. Despite all this, this semi-literate buffoon has rallied all Americans behind him in a case of mass jingoism, making the left-right divide an analytically useless concept in the US context. 

Thanks to a relentless corporate media campaign that has been manufacturing an alternate reality that goes beyond the Orwellian, Americans who now question Assad's use of chemical weapons or the legitimacy of the US strikes are treated as irrational and delusional and generally psychopathologized, although the very source of these accusations and air strikes  is a leader who until very recently was himself psychopathologized as ""crazy"". 

Voicing dissent on this issue, such as Tulsi Gabbard's, is met with incredulous disbelief: ""are you more inclined to believe Assad and Russia than ur own colleagues?""

""The New Transformation
According to American allegations, the al-Shayrat air base was attacked because the Syrian fighter jet was loaded with chemical agents in that air base and went on to bombard Khan Sheikhoun.
However, following the brutal American bombing of the air base, we did not witness any dispersal of toxic chemicals in and around the air base; so where is this alleged stockpile of chemicals being kept at al-Shayrat air base? How did it suddenly disappear without a trace after the American criminal missile attack?

We ask these questions despite the fact that we know the answers, and despite the fact that we know that the alleged chemical attack on Khan Sheikhou was fabricated by Syria's enemies, who have been targeting this country for six years, thinking they could change the balance of power on the ground.
This comes after the great victories that the Syrian Army and its allies had achieved against the terrorists in Damascus and Hama, in which ISIS and al-Nusra suffered huge losses. In these battles, the al-Shayrat air base was attacked relentlessly by ISIS and al-Nusra, but the heroes of the Syrian Army repelled them time and again, inflcting huge losses. So, these terrorist groups had no alternative but to call on the United States to help them target this air base.

The false accusations made against the Syrian Government will also undermine what has been achieved in Astana and Geneva, and have proven without a doubt the moral bankruptcy of the other side.

Nonetheless, and despite the pain, this American aggression against our sacred homeland is not without benefits, because it proves beyond any doubt that the conspirators, which the West calls ""opposition,"" who supported this aggression against their homeland, should from now always be labeled traitors, because they committed an act of grand treason against their country by calling for the continuation of the American aggression.

On the other hand, there were many voices in the West that took an honorable stance against these fabrications, including officials, members of parliament, and journalists. The corporate media was not able this time to take over the whole narrative in the West.
However, our Arab media should pay attention to alternative media outlets in the West, which have proven their credibility, and they are spreading ever wider and gaining more trust at the expense of corporate media. The contradictions within the American administration were also interesting to note, and it is obvious that President Trump is struggling to figure out his policy, and it is also obvious that he is unable to live up to his campaign promise of no intervening in the affairs of other countries, as he has now used military power to attack a sovereign nation which is a member of the United Nations under false pretenses.

The transformation unfolding today, indicated in part by the aggression against Syria, is that the United States is no longer a Great Power in the world, but a country that contradicts itself, and the treacherous Arabs and Turks who supported its aggression will soon discover that they have built their hopes on a mirage, and it won't save them from the terrible fate that awaits them.

The transformation unfolding today is that Russia is a main pole of the international system, with different ways and means to conduct its affairs, because it's an international power that respects other countries and peoples, as well as international legitimacy, and it refuses aggression and stands firmly against it, as was the case with the recent aggression against Syria.

The transformation unfolding today is that China, Brazil, India, Bolivia, and other countries, do not accept aggression and aggressors, and it is only a matter of time before these countries form an international alliance with Russia that would expose the weakness and hypocrisy of the Western alliance.

The transformation unfolding today is that the steadfastness of Syria and its allies for six long years has become a focal point for a new international balance of power. And after these tough years, there will come a time when the allies of resistance will emerge victorious against terrorism and its backers.

The transformation unfolding today is deep and real, and we have to be patient and persistent, and we have to honor all the sacrifices made by building a better future, which is undoubtedly within our grasp.""

Moscow warns against new US missile strikes on Syria, chief of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said at a news briefing on Tuesday.

Militants are preparing a provocation against the Syrian government.

""Militants are delivering toxic chemicals in Khan Shaykhun, the Jira airport, East Ghouta and to the West of Aleppo,"" the Russian General Staff said. The aim of these actions is to forge another pretext for accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons and for triggering new US strikes.""

The general reiterated that the Syrian army does not possess chemical weapons, while the remaining two chemical weapons production and storage facilities in Syria are located on the territory controlled by the so-called armed opposition groups.

""We demand a thorough investigation of the alleged chemical attack by Syrian aviation on the city of Khan-Shaykhun,"" Rudskoi said.

The authenticity of media reports accusing Syrian authorities of the use of chemical weapons in Idlib province raises serious doubts, the Russian General Staff said.

""We have carefully analyzed the materials in the media accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons in the settlement of Khan Shaykhun in Idlib province, their authenticity is highly questionable,"" Rudskoi said.

Russia has information of a possible incident similar to the one in Idlib province, possibly targeting a Damascus suburb, President Vladimir Putin says. 

""We have reports from multiple sources that false flags like this one – and I cannot call it otherwise – are being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus. They plan to plant some chemical there and accuse the Syrian government of an attack,"" he said at a joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Moscow.

The incident has not been properly investigated as yet, but the US fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase in a demonstration of force over what it labeled a chemical attack by Damascus.

""President Mattarella and I discussed it, and I told him that this reminds me strongly of the events in 2003, when the US representatives demonstrated at the UN Security Council session the presumed chemical weapons found in Iraq. The military campaign was subsequently launched in Iraq and it ended with the devastation of the country, the growth of the terrorist threat and the appearance of Islamic State [IS, formerly ISIS] on the world stage,"" he added.

Putin reiterated the call to properly investigate what happened in Khan Sheikhoun, saying that the alleged use of chemical weapons demands one.

""We are planning to address the corresponding UN structure in The Hague and call on the international community to thoroughly investigate all those reports and take appropriate action based on the results of such a probe,"" he said.

A separate report of a potential false flag operation in Syria came from the Russian General Staff, which said militants were transporting toxic agents into several parts of Syria, including Eastern Ghouta, the site of the 2013 chemical weapons incident.

""These actions are aimed at creating a new pretext for accusing the government of Syria of more chemical weapons attacks and provoking more strikes by the US,"" said Colonel General Sergey Rudskoy, the head of Operations.

The United States' latest missile attack on a Syrian airfield is reminiscent of its military intervention in Iraq 14 years ago, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday.

""It is reminiscent of the situation in 2003, when the US, the United Kingdom with its few allies invaded Iraq without Security Council approval, in gross violation of international law,"" Lavrov said in Uzbekistan.

He underscored that the late Thursday attack that killed seven people, according to the Homs governor, was an ""act of aggression under an absolutely false pretext.""

The United States did not bother to provide evidence of this week's chemical weapons attack in Syria's Idlib ahead of launching missiles at its military airfield, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

""Now they did not even bother to provide any facts, referring only to photographs and again speculating on the photos of children, and of course on the testimony of various non-governmental organizations… to provoke actions against the Syrian government,"" Lavrov said.

However, Russia will demand the eventual disclosure of truth behind the United States' decision to attack a Syrian military airfield, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized.

""I do not know when we will happen to learn the whole truth on how decisions were made to attack Syria in this situation, but I think that of course the truth must be demanded, and we will do this,"" he said.

The deadly US missile strike on a Syrian airfield was an attempt to distract attention from the terrorist group known commonly as the Nusra Front (banned in Russia), Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov believes.

""The strikes were delivered without waiting for an inspection visit, without waiting for an investigation. It seems that they wanted to diver attention from the same Jabhat al-Nusra,"" Lavrov said.

He expressed an opinion that the group ""continues to be seen as a reserve unit in order to move from negotiations to regime change.""

Peskov also insisted that ""the Syrian army doesn't have chemical weapons,"" saying this had been ""observed and confirmed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a special UN unit.""

""It angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government. This escalation is short-sighted and will lead to more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia—which could lead to nuclear war.

""This Administration has acted recklessly without care or consideration of the dire consequences of the United States attack on Syria without waiting for the collection of evidence from the scene of the chemical poisoning.  If President Assad is indeed guilty of this horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians, I will be the first to call for his prosecution and execution by the International Criminal Court. However, because of our attack on Syria, this investigation may now not even be possible. And without such evidence, a successful prosecution will be much harder.""

Deputy Foreign and Expatriates Minister Fayssal Mikdad stressed that a few weeks ago, the Syrian government provided the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) with information on the transporting of toxic substances into Syria by Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, affirming that Syria stands against using chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, and under any circumstances.

Interviewed by al-Mayadeen TV on Tuesday, Mikdad indicated that over the past few weeks, the Syrian government has provided the OPCW and the UN with documented reports on transporting toxic substances into Syria and storing them to do such an act by the terrorist organizations including Jabhat al-Nusra, pointing out that these documents were obtained by the OPCW and the UN Security Council.

He asserted that the Syrian Arab Army doesn't possess chemical weapons and that it has never used such weapons even in the fiercest battles with the terrorist groups, clarifying that Syria has implemented all of its obligations towards the OPCW and the organization has admitted that.

The Deputy Minister reiterated that using chemical weapons by terrorist organizations again on Syrian territories aims at achieving a cheap political gain and justifying their failure in the talks of Astana and Geneva.

""Sacrificing the lives of the Syrian civilians in this way to achieve political goals is a cheap policy,"" Mikdad said, referring in this regard to the statement of the head of the Turkish regime Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which he shed crocodile tears for the fate of the Syrian people although he is responsible for the death of tens of thousands of Syrians.

""We are witnessing one of the attacks which have been repeated over the past few weeks and months,"" he went on to say, indicating that the victory of Aleppo and the advances achieved by the Syrian Arab Army in the surroundings of Damascus and Hama are the reason behind this attack.

He called upon the UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura to be reasonable and to practice the role of honest mediator, and not to stand by terrorism, adding that the terrorist groups and their backers in Britain, France, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are the ones who committed this crime.

Mikdad called upon the international community to prosecute the parties who committed this crime, considering that the discussions of Brussels Conference which will be held on Wednesday will be for fabricating charges against Syria.

""The terrorist groups and the so-called Syrian oppositions have failed to be in line with the plans and goals of the process of restoring security and stability to Syria, and therefore all these parties are launching today an unjust systematic campaign against Syria,"" he said.

""We strongly condemn these attacks against our people by the terrorist organizations and their backers, particularly the Turkish and Saudi regimes,"" Mikdad said, pointing out that these two regimes do not hesitate to use any weapon in their attempts to undermine the will of the Syrian people and to fabricate accusations against the Syrian government.

This, in the absence of any evidence and before any investigation were carried out. The STWC rushed statement says:

""The aerial attack on Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province, apparently carried out by the regime, which appears to have involved chemical weapons, is another terrible outrage in the war which has devastated Syria since 2011"".

Not only was there any evidence that the attack had been carried out by the Syrian or Russian planes, but previous experience of such 'attacks' and the context in which it took places i.e., like the previous incidents, just before the forthcoming Syria peace conference, indicated that it is most likely another false flag by the terrorists. After all who is to benefit from such an outrage?

It is now confirmed that ""Syrian aviation airstrike on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhun on Tuesday targeted workshops to produce chemical-laden projectiles, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday.

""According to Russian airspace monitoring systems, yesterday between 11.30 and 12.30 local time the Syrian aviation carried out an airstrike on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhun, targeting a major ammunition storage facility of terrorists and a cluster of military hardware. The territory of this storage facility housed workshops to produce projectiles stuffed with toxic agents,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said.

""From this major arsenal, chemical-laden weapons were delivered by militants to Iraq. Their use by terrorists was confirmed on numerous occasions by international organizations and official authorities of the country,"" he said.

The spokesman added that these projectiles were similar to those used by militants in Syria's Aleppo, where their use was recorded by Russian military specialists.

""Video footage from social networks shows that those affected in Khan Sheikhun demonstrate the same symptoms of poisoning as the victims of the Aleppo attack had last fall,"" he added.
The official said that Russia has handed over all information about the incident to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which ""still studies them.""

Well no, especially since a chemical attack is the easiest ""false flag"" imaginable, and comes just one week after the Trump administration said it no longer plans on removing Assad, a radical departure from the foreign policy of the Obama administration.

And yet, just like last time, the media swallowed the full story and ran with it without asking a single question if maybe this was once again an attempt to escalate the conflict by the , and on Tuesday afternoon, the Trump White House was quick to blame the chemical weapons attack in Syria's Idlib province on the government of President Bashar al-Assad and said the incident was ""reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world.""

However, in an attempt to score some quick political points, instead of questioning the entire attack, the administration which just one week ago said it would no longer seek to oust Assad, promptly blamed the Obama administration for the attack.

Lyn Smith:
""IT IS TIME. It is time to stand up and be counted. I am afraid the fakery, the disingenuous reporting and deliberate and callous misrepresenting of facts in #Syria reached a new low today. 

It is always unfortunate, and impossible, to try to 'choose a side' in a war situation. Not that Syria has ever been a genuine war situation. However, we can do something here. We are not helpless. We can choose to show our immediate and ongoing disgust for people such as Boris Johnson and Theresa May, and Federica Mogherini, the 'EU's high representative for foreign affairs', who according to Yahoo News, ""told delegates at a conference on Syria in Brussels that Bashar al-Assad's regime bore responsibility for the atrocity"" - with not one single shred of actual evidence - referring to alleged gas attacks and bombings earlier that morning. Boris Johnson, even though these ""alleged attacks"" , by the admission of the very people reporting the attacks, ""cannot be verified"".. this has not stopped Boris from coming out to say, before any investigation, ""This bears all the hallmarks of an attack by the regime which has repeatedly used chemical weapons,"" he continued: ""If this is shown to be the work of the regime, it is further evidence of the atrocities perpetrated against the Syrian people over six years of appalling conflict."" 

Even the #CIA has acknowledged now that Assad had absolutely no means to carry out the alleged previous gas attacks on Syrian civilians. This has not stopped Boris from repeating and repeating the company line again and again without shame. And it is here that he displays his utter and complete denial of facts, and his complete ignorance of the real plight of those living in Syria today.
Boris Johnson is showing a chilling, callous disregard and blatant contempt for the suffering of millions of people by refusing to acknowledge what is actually happening on the ground in Syria. 

If you do not which side to be on in Syria, at least be on the side of no more lying. Write to them every day, write to tell these people you have had enough and need them to behave with more integrity and professionalism. You can tell a person is lying when the repeat company lines with no deviation, no regard or curiousity for the finer points, for the actual facts that are coming out daily from Syrian people. 

When a person is only prepared to hear one side of an argument, as is indeed my own MP Will Quince.. you either buy everything the media and government is saying as gospel, basically that ""Assad is bad, Russia is bad, that is the end of the discussion"".. or you must be, by default, ""an evil dictator apologist"" (!)... Something I have been accused of myself more than once by my own MP for daring to question details of the media coverage in Syria. But we should all have alarm bells going off in a big way. 

You should know your emotions and sympathies are being played like a fiddle by your own government. You should be asking them hard questions about why they have lost all objectivity in a situation in which they claim to have no vested interest apart from ""peacekeeping and protection"". Like I said, it is time to stand up and be counted.""

The Syrian Air Force has destroyed a warehouse in Idlib province, where ammunition dump containing chemical weapons was being produced by militants before being delivered to Iraq, the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman has said.

The strike, which was launched midday Tuesday, targeted a major rebel ammunition depot east of the town of Khan Sheikhoun, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement.

The warehouse was used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas, Konashenkov said. The shells were delivered to Iraq and repeatedly used there, he added, pointing out that both Iraq and international organizations have confirmed the use of such weapons by militants.

The same chemical munitions were used by militants in Aleppo, where Russian military experts took samples in late 2016, Konashenkov said.

The Defense Ministry has confirmed this information as ""fully objective and verified,"" Konashenkov added. 

According to the statement, Khan Sheikhoun civilians, who recently suffered a chemical attack, displayed identical symptoms to those of Aleppo chemical attack victims.

The US-led coalition destroyed four bridges in Syria, which interrupted the communication between the north and south of Raqqa, with 200 thousand people, head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoy stated.

""On February 3, the coalition's aviation destroyed four bridges: two in Raqqa and two in the settlements of El-Calta and El-Abbara. As a result of these actions, the communication between the northern and southern parts of the city, with over 200 thousand inhabitants, has been completely interrupted. On February 18, a bridge in El Megle was completely destroyed in the vicinity of the city of Maadan, 60 kilometers east of Raqqa,"" he said.    

He also stated that the Russian General Staff was concerned by the strikes carried out by the international coalition on the dam in the #Euphrates_River in the area of Raqqa.

""Our greatest concern are the airstrikes performed by the coalition's aviation forces on the dam on the Euphrates River west of Raqqa,"" Rudskoy told journalists on Tuesday.

According to Rudskoy, as a result of the March 26 airstrikes, two dampers in the southern part of the dam were damaged, designed for the prevention of the reservoir's overflow.

""These actions could lead to a large-scale environmental catastrophe, the flooding of vast areas and numerous victims among civilians,"" Rudskoy stated.

He summarized by saying that the US-led coalition seems straining after the destruction of Syria's critical infrastructure.

""It seems the international coalition has set itself the goal of completely destroying critical infrastructure in Syria, making it as difficult as possible to postpone the reconstruction of the country,"" the general said.

""In the battle for #Aleppo, #Russia and #Syria established humanitarian corridors – without aid from the UN or other countries. Great care was taken to avoid civilian casualties, why liberating the city entirely took so long.

Moscow ceased aerial operations in October 2016 to protect civilians, long before the battle for Aleppo was won in late December.

The West and supportive media disgracefully portrayed a heroic Leningrad-type liberation as naked aggression.

They're largely silent on the rape and destruction of Mosul. What's reported falsely portrays liberation. Nothing about US terror-bombing mass murder. An orchestrated coverup of reality continues.

No help was provided for desperate city civilians, tapped in harm's way. In months of fighting, likely thousands were massacred, countless others injured, hundreds of thousands displaced – by indiscriminate US terror-bombing and ground artillery fire.""

During the meeting, President al-Assad talked about the latest developments in Syria and responded to the delegation's queries regarding the situation of the Syrian people after six years of war.

President al-Assad added that Syria is going ahead in its vision to solve the crisis through two tracks, combating terrorism and the political process, affirming that Syria is open to hold dialogue with anyone who lay down arms and abide by the constitution.

President al-Assad hailed the Russian support to Syrian people in their war against terrorism, adding that officials in European countries who pretend concern over the Syrian people have to stop supporting terrorist groups and put pressure on countries that fund these groups to stop that because it is also in the interest of their people.

The President  said that the visits of the parliamentary delegations to Syria are very important, adding that what distinguishes this visit is that it is a joint delegation from Russia and Europe and therefore it provides a useful opportunity for dialogue among parliamentarians about the polices of their countries toward events in Syria.

In turn, members of the delegation stressed the importance of international intensified efforts to fight terrorism, considering that the stances of European countries towards what is happening in Syria have begun to change when European officials felt that the danger of terrorism began to reach their home countries.

They considered that the intervention in the internal affairs of other countries brings nothing but only chaos, stressing the importance of dialogue among the Syrians to agree on any step regarding the future Syria.

In the same context, Speaker of the People's Assembly Hadiyeh Abbas met the Russian-European parliamentary delegation.

She said ""we rely on the European parliamentarians and representatives of the peoples of Europe to correct the wrong European policies towards Syria and enhance cooperation and coordination to combat terrorism since it is the only way to protect the Europeans.

For his part, head of the delegation underlined the need to boost the joint parliamentary cooperation between Syria and Russia, noting to the delegation members' keenness on revealing the real image of what is taking place in Syria and convey it to their peoples.

The Russian State Duma Deputy Chairman Vladimir Vasilyev indicated to the warm atmosphere of the delegation's meeting with President al-Assad which lasted for three hours during which the President shared his viewpoints on key issues and listened to their perspectives, views and notes.

He stressed that it has now become clear to all that the Syrian leadership is essential to the dialogue aimed at solving the crisis in the country, adding that President al-Assad briefed the delegation on the latest political developments and the Syrian army's achievements on the ground.

Vasilyev laid stress on the necessity of pushing forward the political dialogue with all forces and enhance the political process in Syria for the sake of the country's future.

He reiterated the Russian leadership, government and Parliament's support to Syria's right to fight terrorism and its extremist ideology, pointing out to the need for eliminate terrorism before its prevailing throughout the entire world.

The head of delegation noted that the Russian State Duma Committee on Foreign Affairs has prepared an agenda which includes proposals which Syria, and even other states, need, the most important of which is the Constitution.

He extended an invitation to the Speaker of People's Assembly to visit Russia in April.

In a press conference, Vasilyev said the visit to Syria aims at inspecting the reality of what is taking place on the ground and offer the delegation members' parliamentary expertise to the Syrian MPs.

He described the meeting with President al-Assad as ""constructive and fruitful"", noting that the delegation members, including the European parliamentarians, were satisfied and delighted over the outcomes of the meeting.

Vasilyev said that the delegation has submitted several proposals and thoughts to President al-Assad, including opinions about constitution, encouraging local reconciliations and truces.

The formation of a constitutional committee and its work mechanism were also discussed, he added.

He indicated to the small number of countries which provide humanitarian aid to Syria such as Russia, China, Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, calling for mobilizing efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.

The gunmen and their families left for the northern countryside of Homs province in the framework of implementing the reconciliation agreement that was reached in the neighborhood, paving the way for the return of all the governmental institutions to it.

SANA reporter in Homs said 432 gunmen who rejected the reconciliation agreement and 1056 of their families have headed towards the northern countryside of Homs.

Homs Governor Talal al-Barazi told SANA reporter that the governorate has completed all logistic preparations and measures for getting the first batch of the gunmen out of al-Waer in the framework of implementing the reconciliation agreement which was agreed upon last week.

The Governor added that the first group includes the evacuation of more than 1500 gunmen and members of their families towards the northeastern countryside of Aleppo province, pointing out that the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and the Syrian and Russian military police supervise the process.

The Governor denied reports circulated by some media outlets which are involved in the bloodshed in Syria that a demographic change is planned for al-Waer neighborhood.

""These lies are a desperate attempt aimed at sabotaging the reconciliation agreement of al-Waer neighborhood in particular and the process of successive reconciliations in general,"" said al-Barazi.

He clarified that over 40,000 people will stay in the neighborhood after all the gunmen who reject the reconciliation leave along with their families, who are 10,000 people in total.

He added that the governorate is working on drawing up a comprehensive plan to secure the return of all the families that had earlier left their houses in al-Waer neighborhood after the evacuation process is completed and services are fully restored.

Secretary of Homs Branch of al-Baath Arab Socialist Party Ammar al-Sibaai noted that over 100,000 people are expected to return to their homes after the reconciliation agreement is fully implemented.

Commander of Homs Police Mag. Gen. Khaled Hilal said after the agreement is fully completed, al-Waer neighborhood will be declared secure, and consequently the whole city of Homs will be fully secured.

He added that units of the Internal Security Forces will be back on duty in al-Waer neighborhood once the agreement is accomplished, affirming that security will be established in the neighborhood and families will return to their homes.

Last Monday, a reconciliation agreement was reached in al-Waer neighborhood in Homs city providing for settling the situation of the gunmen in the neighborhood and the evacuation of those who reject the settlement with their families, paving the way for the return of the state institutions, in coordination between the security and military committee in Homs and the Russian reconciliation center in Hmeimim-base.

Al-Waer is the last neighborhood in the city of Homs where armed groups still spread, imposing a siege on the locals.

In March 2014, armed groups were evacuated from the old city of Homs.

Conflicting reports on an alleged airstrike on an Aleppo mosque won't change the Pentagon's attitude towards the various shady ""activist"" groups they cite as ""reliable"" sources when it suits them, says retired US AF Lieutenant Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski.

RT:The Pentagon has admitted that the airstrike was targeting a site 15 meters (about 50 feet) away from the mosque. If that was the distance, is it possible that the mosque could have been left undamaged?

Karen Kwiatkowski: I think we would have seen some damage, even if they would have hit that close. And, also, it seems it may be like a part of the mosque complex, it seems they are playing semantics with the targeting.

#Gabbard: 'Iraqi, Syrian Leaders Most Sincere in Fighting #Terrorism'

U.S. Congresswoman #Tulsi Gabbard made new surprising remarks on Friday in which she once again supported Syrian President Bashar #Assad, calling him and the Iraqi premier ""the most genuine people in their efforts to fight terrorism.""

The Hawaiian Democratic Representative who was being interviewed by #CNN criticized U.S. policies of regime change in Syria saying she is 'surprised' by the media coverage of the Middle East crises. She said there are no moderate rebels in Syria but there are terrorist groups like al-Nusra, al-Qaeda and Ahrar al-Sham, and #ISIS who are being provided support by the United States and other allies like #Saudi Arabia, #Turkey and #Qatar to topple the Syrian president.

""I believe the most genuine people in their efforts to fight terrorism right now are the Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and the Syrian President Bashar Assad. We cannot ignore the great efforts of the Russian President #Putin in supporting these two countries in fighting terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Nusra,"" claimed Gabbard. ""The United States draws a distinction between terrorists, dividing them into good and bad terrorists.""

The U.S lawmaker had a seven-day trip to Syria and Lebanon in January where she met and talked with many Syrian refugees, Syrian opposition leaders, widows and family members of Syrians fighting alongside groups like al-Qaeda, as well as those fighting on the side of the government, and also some #Christian clergymen of the war-stricken city of #Aleppo.
....

Although an #Iraq War veteran, Gabbard was against the invasion of Iraq. She said in late 2012, ""I was against the war in Iraq. We never should have gone there in the first place."" She believes that the United States' victory conditions in Iraq were not been clearly defined. In 2014 she voted against renewed U.S. military engagement in Iraq.""

Syria affirmed that the Israeli aggression that took place on Friday, which is a violation of international law, the UN Charter, and the sovereignty and the sanctity of Syrian territory, was not the first of its kind but is a part of a long series of attacks carried out by Israel to support its agents in the terrorist war on Syria.

In two letters sent by the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry to the UN Secretary General and the President of Security Council, the Ministry said that in flagrant defiance of the international legitimacy and UN resolutions and the sovereignty and the inviolability of the Syrian territory, four Israeli warplanes violated the Syrian airspace in al-Breij area through the Lebanese territories at 2:40 am and targeted a military site in the eastern countryside of Homs province.

""As part of its right to defend the sanctity of its territory, the Syrian air defense responded to this aggression and shot down one of the planes while the rest of them were forced to flee,"" the Ministry added.

The Ministry went on to say that the Syrian Arab Republic confirms that all Israeli security, military, and political resources have been harnessed directly and indirectly in order to enable terrorists to weaken Syria and to prolong the terrorist war as much as possible.

""The Israeli aggression this morning comes as a new Israeli attempt to boost the collapsed morale of terrorist groups after they were defeated recently by the Syrian Arab Army and its allies in many areas,"" the Ministry said in the letters.

The Ministry added that Syria confirms that all the pretexts and allegations made by Israel to justify the launching of such attacks are cheap diversionary attempts that have been used every time Israel fails to justify the continuation of its illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan, the Palestinian territory, and the rest of the occupied territories in southern Lebanon.

""Syria calls on the UN Secretary General and the President of the UNSC to condemn this blatant Israeli aggression, to force Israel to stop supporting terrorism in Syria, to implement all UNSC resolutions on counter-terrorism, including resolution No. 2253, to withdraw from the whole occupied Syrian Golan to the line of June 4th, 1967, and to implement resolution No. 497 for 1981.

The Ministry concluded its letters by affirming that the Israeli aggressions on Syria not only threaten peace and security in the region, but also threaten security and stability in all parts of the world.

The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday adopted the Syrian Arab Republic's report on the main causes of crisis in Syria and the challenges resulted from it, submitted within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the situation of human rights.

The report sheds light on the situation of human rights in Syria, the adopted protection mechanisms and the negative impact of terrorism on all aspects of life and human rights in the country.

Syria's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ambassador Hussam Eddin Ala, said that presenting this report within the framework of the comprehensive regular review and Syria's positivity, honesty and transparency in discussing it affirm its cooperation with objective, indiscriminative mechanisms, its commitment to dialogue and its efforts to enhance human rights in line with the UN Charter and Human Rights Declaration.

He added that the report reviews the main reasons behind the crisis in Syria and the accompanying challenges as well as efforts exerted by the country to deal with these challenges with special indication to the big role of regional-backed terrorism in depriving the Syrian people from their rights and the negative effects of unjust unilateral procedures on basic rights, particularly nutrition and health.

Ambassador Ala said that Syria has welcomed and agreed all the constructive notes and recommendations presented by states which abided by the standards of the UPR mechanism that is based on dialogue, cooperation and non-interference in other states' internal affairs.

He condemned the attempts of some states which tried to exploit the mechanism to politicize the issue and take the human rights as a pretext to adopt hostile policies towards certain states.

The Ambassador said that the terrorist crimes which claimed the lives of dozens of victims in Damascus leave no doubt the need to give counterterrorism the priority and force states which back terrorism in Syria to halt their support to the terrorist organizations and comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

In conclusion, Ala laid stress on Syria's commitment to reach a political solution to the crisis in Syria that is based on Syrian-Syrian dialogue which guarantees the Syrian people's right to decide their destiny without any foreign intervention and preserve Syria's sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity.

100681426711941_1286327274814011,"#mustread - 'Why are we at war in #Syria?' | By Dennis Kucinich 

[Full article]

The United States government is now at war in Syria, with nearly 1,000 combat-ready U.S. troops providing artillery and air support in the north. We have put our troops in an impossible and perilous position, with enemies on all sides.

The war in Syria is not a fight for democracy. The U.S. is fighting alongside and supporting the cause of 80,000 jihadis from 90 different countries. Nearly a half-million Syrians have died in the war fueled by this sinister worldwide participation.

The U.S. is equipping terrorists who keep changing their name, but the game is the same: To unite and achieve a radical Islamic fundamentalist takeover of the region.

Billions of U.S. tax dollars have helped spawn this war, creating death and misery, massive migrations of refugees and immigration crises.

The U.S. presence in Syria is an illegal act of war. It violates international law and it is unconstitutional. Syria did not invite the U.S. to come in. Congress has not approved it. Syria has been fighting Al Qaeda, Al Nusra, ISIS and other radical Islamic terror groups to whom Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and the U.S. have given direct and indirect aid.

ISIS and the other terrorist groups can be defeated by cutting off their funds, which is exactly what Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's just-introduced bill, the Stop Arming Terrorists Act (HR 608), aims to do. A companion bill, S. 532, has been introduced in the Senate by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

Most of the media is fueling the war, unwittingly becoming a mouthpiece for the masterful, intelligent propagandists of jihadi groups whose ""humanitarian"" messaging permeates every level of social media. It tugs at the conscience of caring people while masking the reality of violent subjugation and religious extremism that propels their movement.

A deeper question needs to be asked: Why is it U.S. policy to upend Syrian society, whose tradition has been to respect freedom of worship by people of all faiths, and replace it with religious extremism?

Syria provides its people with universal health care and universal education, up to postgraduate level. Its literacy rate is approximately that of the United States. Before the war, Syria was moving progressively toward a society where women have full rights and are free to come and go as they wish, to dress as they wish, to participate in all occupations.

Have we not learned our lessons from Iraq and Libya, where our direct interventions set the trajectory for democracy back to the Dark Ages? We are destroying every American value we say we support with this senseless, reckless behavior.

Is the U.S. presence emboldening those who want to destroy Syria? On Saturday morning, more than 40 Iraqi pilgrims traveling by bus to a holy site in a cemetery in downtown Damascus were killed, and more than 120 were injured, when explosive devices were detonated. The group claiming responsibility for this massacre? Tahrir al-Sham, a deadly hybrid of Al Qaeda, so-called ""moderates"" previously backed by the U.S.

The attack on this previously safe area of old Damascus signals a new and more dangerous phase of the efforts of radical Islamic fundamentalists to overturn the Syrian government through acts of terror and paramilitary assaults.

Why in the world does the United States want to help establish a fundamentalist caliphate, guided by Shariah law? Why, in fact, has our government given mere lip service to the slaughter of Christians and the desecration of holy places in the region? How does this reflect American values?

Some people say that if we fight them over there, we won't have to fight them over here. They are wrong. It's not that we are fighting them over there. We are supporting them over there, with our tax dollars and now our troops.

Every day we occupy Syria, we arm, train and empower our enemies and put our brave young men and women at risk, using them as pawns in an insane game of nations.

If we really are serious about fighting terrorism and making America safer, we must look to history, learn from our mistakes and get off this endlessly expensive wheel of war.

For their part, the members of the delegation, who belong to several European states and parties, confirmed their intention to proceed with their efforts to correct the erroneous views both on the political and popular levels towards what is happening in Syria, in addition to continuing work towards restoring diplomatic relations between the EU states and Syria, and towards lifting the sanctions imposed on Syria, which would contribute to restoring security and stability to the country.""

Peter Theo Curtis, an American journalist who is known by his pen name Theo Padnos, was asked to share his view on how the war in Syria is seen in the West. Abducted by Al-Qaeda affiliated Al-Nusra Front in 2012 while trying to sneak into rebel-controlled Syrian territory, he gained insight into the various armed factions fighting the government, from the ""moderate"" Free Syrian Army to hardcore Islamists.

""Western media coverage of the Syrian crisis is inadequate and biased, while most things reported about #Aleppo are false or unprovable""

""Something very dangerous and alarming is occurring in northwestern Syria, and this is the emergence of the second Islamic State there,"" he stressed.

The new terrorist grouping possesses ""tons of weapons,"" he warned, noting that it includes rebels defeated by the Syrian army in Aleppo, Homs, Daraa, and the outskirts of Damascus who were ""shipped up to the northwestern Syria.""

They are particularly active in the province of #Idlib ""governing itself by #Sharia law which involves shooting people on the street. As somebody who has been tried in an Islamic court up there, I know what it's like. It's not exactly justice; it's not democracy; it's not what we want; it's not exactly justice; it's not what we want for our fellow human beings,"" he told RT, stressing ""we should pity the women and the children up there.""

""It could carry on forever unless the outside world can really stop sending missiles to the rebels,"" the journalist warned.

100681426711941_1282426671870738,"#Syria | An Extract from President Assad's interview with Chinese PHOENIX TV

Question 4: Talking about the Syria war, you can never exclude the foreign factors. The Saudi-backed high negotiating committee, HNC, are saying that they are counting on the Trump administration to play a positive role instead of the mistaken policies under his predecessor Barack Obama. So, from your side, what do you expect from Trump's Middle East policy, particularly policy on Syria?

President Assad: The first part that you mentioned about their hopes, when you pin your hopes on a foreign country, doesn't matter which foreign country, it means you're not patriotic, and this is proved, because they should depend on the support of the Syrian people, not any other government or administration.

Now, regarding the Trump administration, during his campaign and after the campaign, the main rhetoric of the Trump administration and the president himself was about the priority of defeating ISIS. I said since the beginning that this is a promising approach to what's happening in Syria and in Iraq, because we live in the same area and we face the same enemy. We haven't seen anything concrete yet regarding this rhetoric, because we've been seeing now certain is a local kind of raids. You cannot deal with terrorism on local basis; it should be comprehensive, it cannot be partial or temporary. It cannot be from the air, it should be in cooperation with the troops on the ground, that's why the Russians succeeded, since they supported the Syrian Army in pushing ISIS to shrink, not to expand as it used to be before that. So, we have hopes that this taking into consideration that talking about ISIS doesn't mean talking about the whole terrorism; ISIS is one of the products, al-Nusra is another product, you have so many groups in Syria, they are not ISIS, but they are Al Qaeda, they have the same background of the Wahabi extremist ideology.

Question 5: So, Mr. President, you and Mr. Donald Trump actually share the same priority which is counter-terrorism, and both of you hate fake news. Do you see any room for cooperation?

President Assad: Yeah, in theory, yes, but practically, not yet, because there's no link between Syria and the United States on the formal level. Even their raids against ISIS that I just mentioned, which are only a few raids, happened without the cooperation or the consultation with the Syrian Army or the Syrian government which is illegal as we always say. So, theoretically we share those goals, but particularly, not yet.

Question 6: Do you have personal contact with the President of the United States?

President Assad: Not at all.

Journalist: Direct or indirect.

President Assad: Indirect, you have so many channels, but you cannot bet on private channels. It should be formal, this is where you can talk about a real relation with another government.

Question 7: As we speak, top generals from Turkey, Russia, and the United States are meeting somewhere in Turkey to discuss tensions in northern Syria, where mutually- suspicious forces are allied with these countries.  So, do you have a plan for a final attack on Daesh when the main players actually do need an effective coordination in order to clear Syria of all terror groups?

President Assad: Yeah, if you want to link that meeting with ISIS in particular, it won't be objective, because at least one party, which is Turkey, has been supporting ISIS till this moment, because Erdogan, the Turkish President, is Muslim Brotherhood. He's ideologically linked and sympathetic with ISIS and with al-Nusra, and everybody knows about this in our region, and he helped them either through armaments, logistically, through exporting oil. For the other party, which is the United States, at least during Obama's administration, they dealt with ISIS by overlooking their smuggling the Syrian oil to Turkey, and this is how they can get money in order to recruit terrorists from around the world, and they didn't try to do anything more than cosmetic against ISIS. The only serious party in that regard is Russia, which is effectively attacking ISIS in cooperation with us. So, the question is: how can they cooperate, and I think the Russians have hope that the two parties join the Russians and the Syrians in their fight against terrorism. So, we have more hopes now regarding the American party because of the new administration, while in Turkey nothing has changed in that regard. ISIS in the north have  only one route of supply, it's through Turkey, and they're still alive and they're still active and they're still resisting different kinds of waves of attacks, because of the  Turkish support.

Question 8: Now, US troops are in Manbej. Is the greenlight from your side? Did you open the door for these American troops?

President Assad: No, no, we didn't. Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation or consultation or permission, they are invaders, whether they are American, Turkish, or any other one. And we don't think this is going to help. What are they going to do? To fight ISIS?  The Americans lost nearly every war. They lost in Iraq, they had to withdraw at the end. Even in Somalia, let alone Vietnam in the past and Afghanistan, your neighboring country. They didn't succeed anywhere they sent troops, they only create a mess; they are very good in creating problems and destroying, but they are very bad in finding solutions.

China's Phoenix TV interviewed Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad on Saturday morning to discuss several topics related to his country and region.

During the interview, the Chinese journalist asked the Syrian President what his thoughts were regarding the trilateral meeting taking place between military officials from the U.S., Turkey, and Russia.

The Syrian President responded that the meeting itself was not objective because there is at least one party, which is Turkey, that is sympathetic to the Islamic State (ISIS).

""Yeah, if you want to link that meeting with ISIS in particular, it won't be objective because at least one party, which is Turkey, has been supporting ISIS till this moment,"" Assad asserted on Saturday morning.

""Because Erdogan, the Turkish President, is Muslim Brotherhood. He's ideologically linked and sympatheti with ISIS and with Al-Nusra. Everybody knows about this in our region and he helped them either through armaments, logistics, and exporting oil,"" Assad added.

Tensions between Turkey and Syria were believed to be improved up until recently, when the Turkish Armed Forces carried out sporadic attacks against the Syrian Arab Army in northeast Aleppo.

The president added in an interview given to Chinese PHOENIX TV  that the solution to the crisis in Syria should be through two parallel ways: the first one is to fight the terrorists, and this is our duty as government, to defend the Syrians and use any means in order to destroy the terrorists who've been killing and destroying in Syria, and the second one is to make dialogue.

Following is the full text of the interview:

Question 1:  Thank you Mr. President for having us here in Dimashq, the capital of Syria. I think this is the first interview you have with Chinese media after the national ceasefire and after so many fresh rounds of talks, both in Astana and in Geneva, and of course after US President Donald Trump's inauguration, and these days, as we have seen, your troops are making steady progress in battlefields, but peace talks do not seem just as productive. So, as far as the Geneva talks is concerned, your chief negotiator, Mr. Jaafari, was trying hard to find out who should be sitting on the other side of the negotiation table. So, according to your idea, who should be sitting there?

President Assad: This is a very crucial question. If you want those negotiations to be fruitful, we have to ask ""who is going to be sitting there?"" I mean, there could be a lot of good people with good intentions, but the question is: who do they represent? That's the question. In this situation, you have different groups, you have people who are, let's say, patriotic, but they don't represent anyone, they represent themselves. You have others who represent the terrorists, and you have terrorists on the table, and you have others who represent the agenda of foreign countries like Saudi Arabia, like Turkey, like France, UK and maybe the United States. So, it's not a homogeneous meeting. If you want it to be fruitful, going back to the first point that I mentioned, it should be a real Syrian-Syrian negotiations. In spite of that, we went to that meeting because we think any kind of dialogue could be a good step toward the solution, because even those people who are terrorists or belonging to the terrorists or to other countries, they may change their mind and go back to their normality by going back to being real Syrians, detach themselves from being terrorists or agents to other groups. That's why I say we didn't expect Geneva to produce anything, but it's a step, and it's going to be a long way, and you may have other rounds, whether in Geneva or in Astana.

Question 2: But anyway, it is an intra-Syrian talks, right? But the matter of fact is, it is proxy dialogue. I mean, main parties do not meet and have dialogue directly.

President Assad: Exactly.

Journalist: Are you personally satisfied with the current negotiation format or mechanism?

President Assad: we didn't forge this mechanism; it was forged by de Mistura and the UN with the influence of the countries that wanted to use those negotiations in order to make pressure on Syria, not to reach any resolution. As you just said, each one represents a different agenda, even the opposition delegations, it wasn't one delegation; different delegations of the opposition. So, if I'm going to – as a government – if I'm going to negotiate with someone, who's it going to be? Which one? Who represents who? That's our question. So, you are right, this time there was no negotiations in Geneva, but this is one of the reasons, that's why it didn't reach anything. The only thing we discussed in Geneva was the agenda, the headlines, what are we going to discuss later, that's it.

Question 3: But as we see, lot of time, money, energy have been put into this effort, and the clashes are still going on, people are still dying, and the refugees are still increasing.

President Assad: Exactly.

Journalist: What is the possible way of having a negotiation?

President Assad: Again, you are correct. The more delay you have, the more harm and destruction and killing and blood you'll have within Syria, that's why we are very eager to achieve a solution, but how and in which way? You need to have two parallel ways: the first one is to fight the terrorists, and this is our duty as government, to defend the Syrians and use any means in order to destroy the terrorists who've been killing and destroying in Syria. The second one is to make dialogue. This dialogue has many different aspects; you have the political one, which is related to the future of Syria; what political system do you need, what kind? It doesn't matter which one, it depends on the Syrians, and they're going to have referendum about what they want. The second part is to try to bring many of those people who were affiliated to the terrorists or who committed any terrorist acts to go back to their normality and lay down their armaments and to live normal life in return for amnesty that has been offered by the government, and we've been going in that direction for three years, and it worked very well. It worked very well. So, actually, if you want to talk about the real political solution since the beginning of the crisis, of the war on Syria, till this moment, the only solution was those reconciliations between the government and the different militants in Syria, many of them joined the government now, and they are fighting with the government. Some of them laid down their.

Question 4: But talking about the Syria war, you can never exclude the foreign factors. The Saudi-backed high negotiating committee, HNC, are saying that they are counting on the Trump administration to play a positive role instead of the mistaken policies under his predecessor Barack Obama. So, from your side, what do you expect from Trump's Middle East policy, particularly policy on Syria?

Even in Somalia, let alone Vietnam in the past and Afghanistan, your neighboring country. They didn't succeed anywhere they sent troops, they only create a mess; they are very good in creating problems and destroying, but they are very bad in finding solutions.

Question 9: Talking about Russia and China, they just vetoed a new UN sanction on Syria last week. What do these Chinese vetoes mean exactly for your country?

President Assad: Let's be very clear about their position, which is not to support the Syrian government or the Syrian president, because in the West they try to portray it as a personal problem, and as Russia and China and other countries and Iran support that person as president. It's not the case. China is a member of the Security Council, and it's committed to the Charter of the United Nations. In that veto, China has defended first of all the Charter, because the United Nations was created in order to restore stability around the world. Actually, the Western countries, especially the permanent members of the Council as a tool or means in order to change regimes or governments and to  implement their agenda, not to restore stability, and actually to create more instability around the world. So the second part is that China restored stability in the world by creating some kind of political balance within the United Nations, of course in cooperation with Russia, which is very important for the whole world. Of course, Syria was the headline, the main headline, this is good for Syria, but again it's good for the rest of the world. Third, the same countries that wanted to use the UN Charter for their own vested interested are the same countries who interfered or tried to intervene in your country in the late 90s, and they used different headlines, human rights, and so on, and you know that, and if they had the chance, they would change every government in the world, whether big country or small country, just when this government tries to be a little bit independent. So, China protected the Chinese interests, Syrian interests, and the world interests, especially the small countries or the weak countries.

Question 10: If I'm not mistaken, you said China is going to play a role in the reconstruction of Syria. So, in which areas you think China can contribute to bring Syrian people back to their normal life after so many years of hardships?

President Assad: Actually, if you talk about what the terrorists have been doing the last six years, it's destroying everything regarding the infrastructure. In spite of that, the Syrian government is still effective, at least by providing the minimum needs for the Syrian people. But they've been destroying everything in every sector with no exception. Adding to that, the Western embargo in Syria has prevented Syria from having even the basic needs for the livelihood of any citizen in Syria. So, in which sector? In every sector. I mean, China can be in every sector with no exception, because we have damage in every sector. But if we talk about now, before this comprehensive reconstruction starts, China now is being involved directly in building many projects, mainly industrial projects, in Syria, and we have many Chinese experts now working in Syria in different projects in order to set up those projects. But of course, when you have more stability, the most important thing is building the destroyed suburbs. This is the most important part of the reconstruction. The second one is the infrastructure; the sanitation system, the electricity, the oil fields, everything, with no exception. The third one: the industrial projects, which could belong to the private sector or the public sector in Syria.

Question 11: Alright. And it seems no secret that there are some Chinese extremists are here, fighting alongside Daesh. I think it is a threat to both Syria and China. What concrete or effective measures do you have to control border and prevent these extremists from free movement in the region?

President Assad: When you talk about extremists or terrorists, it doesn't matter what their nationality is, because they don't recognize borders, and they don't belong to a country. The only difference between nationality and nationality, is that those for example who came from your country, they know your country more than the others, so they can do more harm in your country that others, and the same for Syrians, the same for Russian terrorist, and so on. So now, the measures, every terrorist should be defeated and demolished, unless he changed his position to the normal life. Second, because you're talking about different nationalities -more than 80 nationalities – you should have cooperation with the other governments, especially in the intelligence field, and that's what's happening for example with the Chinese intelligence regarding the Uyghur terrorists who are coming from China through Turkey. Unfortunately, the only means that we don't have now and we don't control is our borders with Turkey, because the Uyghur  in Particular, they came from Turkey, the others coming maybe from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, form the sea, maybe, and the majority from Turkey, but the Uyghur terrorists coming mainly from Turkey. Why? I don't know why, but they have the support of the Turkish government, and they were gathered and collected in one group, and they were sent to the northern part of Syria. So, the mission now is to attack them, wherever they existed. Of course, sometimes you cannot tell which one… who is who, they mix with each other, but sometimes they work as separate groups from different nationalities. And this is very crucial kind of cooperation between the Syrian and the Chinese intelligence, and we did many good steps in that regard.

Question 12: Mr. President, as you may be fully aware that the ""White Helmets"" took an Oscar this year for the best documentary short, but folks are saying that the truth about this ""White Helmets"" is not like what Netflix has presented, so what is your take on this?

President Assad: First of all, we have to congratulate al-Nusra for having the first Oscar! This is an unprecedented event for the West to give Al Qaeda an Oscar; this is unbelievable, and this is another proof that the Oscars, Nobel, all these things are politicized certificates, that's how I can look at it. The White Helmets story is very simple; it is a facelift of al-Nusra Front in Syria, just to change their ugly face into a more humanitarian face, that's it. And you have many videos on the net and of course images broadcasted by the White Helmets that condemn the White Helmets as a terrorists group, where you can see the same person wearing the white helmet and celebrating over the dead bodies of Syrian soldiers. So, that's what the Oscar went to, to those terrorists. So, it's a story just to try to prevent the Syrian Army during the liberation of Aleppo from making more pressure on the attacking and liberating the districts within the city that have been occupied by those terrorists, to say that the Syrian Army and the Russians are attacking the civilians and the innocents and the humanitarian people.

Question 13: Right. Now Palmyra. I took a one-day trip to Palmyra this time. Now, the city is under your control, so as its strategic position is concerned, because Homs is the heart of Syria, it's right in the middle, now, when you have Palmyra, what is your next target? Are you going to expand a military operation into Raqqa and Dier Ezzor?

President Assad: We are very close to Raqqa now. Yesterday, our troops reached the Euphrates River which is very close to Raqqa city, and Raqqa is the stronghold of ISIS today, so it's going to be a priority for us, but that doesn't mean the other cities are not priority, in time that could be in parallel, because Palmyra is on the way to Dier Ezzor city in the eastern part of Syria which is close to the Iraqi borders, and those areas that have been used by ISIS as route for logistic support between ISIS in Iraq and ISIS in

Syria. So, whether you attack the stronghold or you attack the route that ISIS uses, it has the same result.

Question 14: How many days do you think this war is going to last?

President Assad: if we presume that you don't have foreign intervention, it will take a few months. It's not very complicated internally. The complexity of this war is the foreign intervention. This is the problem. So, in the face of that intervention, the good thing that we gained during the war is the unity of the society. At the very beginning, the vision for many Syrians wasn't very clear about what's happening. Many believed the propaganda of the West about the reality, about the real story, that this is against the oppression. If it's against the oppression, why the people in Saudi Arabia didn't revolt, for example? So, now what we gained is this, this is our strongest foundation to end that war. We always have hope that this year is going to be the last year. But at the end, this is war and you can't expect what is going to happen precisely.

Question 15: Mr. President, you are President of the Syrian Republic, at the same time, you are a loving husband and a father of three. How can you balance the role of being a President, a father, and a husband?

President Assad: If you cannot succeed in your small duty which is your family, you cannot succeed in your bigger duty or more comprehensive duty at the level of a country. So, there is no excuse that if you have a lot of work to abandon your duties; it's a duty. You have to be very clear about that, you have to fulfill those duties in a very good way. Of course, sometimes those circumstances do not allow you to do whatever you have to do, your duties, fully, let's say.

Journalist: During a day, how much time you spend on work, and how much time you spend with your family members?

President Assad: Actually, it's not about the time, because even if you are at your home, you have to work.

Journalist: Okay.

President Assad: Let's say, in the morning and the evening, you have the chance, but in between and after those times, you have the whole day to work.

Question 16: Have you ever thought of leaving this country for the sake of your family?

President Assad: Never, after six years, I mean the most difficult times passed; it was in 2012 and 2013, those times we never thought about it, how can I think about it now?

So, no, no, this is not an option. Whenever you have any kind of reluctance, you will lose. You will lose not with your enemies; you lose with your supporters. Those supporters, I mean the people you work with, the fighters, the army, they will feel if you're not determined to defend your country. We never had any feeling neither me nor any member of my family.

Question 17: And how is Kareem's Chinese getting along?

President Assad: He learned the basics of Chinese language, I think two years ago. Unfortunately, the lady and the man who taught him had to leave, because they were members of the Chinese Embassy. They went back to China. Now, he stopped improve his Chinese language.

Question 18: Do you think it is a good choice to learn Chinese for him?

President Assad: Of course, of course, because China is a rising power.

Journalist: You didn't force him to learn Chinese? It's his own option, right?

President Assad: No, no, we never thought about it, actually. I didn't think that he has to learn Chinese, and I didn't expect him, if I thought about it, that he would say yes, because for many in the world the Chinese language is a difficult language to learn. He took the initiative and he said I want to learn Chinese, and actually till this moment, I didn't ask him why. I want him to feel free, but when he's getting older, I'm going to ask him how? How did it come through your mind to learn this language, this difficult language, but of course important language.

Journalist: You didn't ask him before? President Assad: No, not yet. Journalist: So, you think it's a good choice?

President Assad: Of course, of course. As I said, it's a rising power, it's important. I mean, most of the world has different kinds of relation with China whether in science, in politics, in economy, in business, I mean, in every filed you need it now. And our relation for the future is going to be on the rise. It was good, but it's going to be on the rise because when a country like China proves that it's a real friend, a friend that you can rely on, it's very natural to have better relation on the popular level, not only on the formal level.

Journalist: Thank you Mr. President, thank you for your time.

President Assad: Thank you for coming to Syria, you're most welcome.

An Army and Armed Forces unit, in cooperation with locals, set up an ambush which resulted in seizing a truck with Turkish papers and license plates that was transporting weapons and ammo to ISIS terrorists in the northern countryside of Hama province.

SANA's correspondent in Hama said that based on information provided by locals, an army unit set up an ambush 1 kilometer into areas where ISIS terrorists are located in Wadi al-Azib area in the direction of al-Sabboura in the province's northern countryside, which resulted in seizing an Isuzu truck.

The truck, which had Turkish papers and license plates, contained 5,516 rounds for 23mm anti-air guns, 111,780 PKC machinegun rounds, and a number of RPG launchers.

That came in two letters sent Friday by Foreign and Expatriates Ministry to the UN Secretary General and President of Security Council on the Turkish forces' continued attacks on the sovereignty of the Syrian territories.

The Syrian government demanded the UN Chief, the Security Council and the international community to oblige Turkey to withdraw its invading forces, stop the attacks and to maintain security and stability in the region and the world.

A military source said on Thursday that the Turkish regime forces targeted today, with rocket and artillery fires, positions for the Syrian Army and the backing forces in Manbij region in Aleppo countryside.

The source told SANA that the Turkish shelling which targeted the points of border guards claimed the lives of a number of persons and wounded many others.

It added that the Turkish aggression on the Syrian Arab republic territories is just an attempt to stop the success and progress made by the Syrian army, and backing forces, in its war against terrorist organizations and the affiliated groups, to restore stability and security to Aleppo countryside and the whole Syrian territories.

The pilot of a Syrian military aircraft, which crashed in Turkey a day ago, said that the plane was shot down. The 56-year-old pilot was identified as Mehmet Sufhan, and medical staff said he was not in critical condition despite some fractures in his spine. 

In an initial statement to Turkish authorities, Sufhan said that the jet took off from the military airbase in Syria's Latakia to carry out airstrikes on militants' targets near the Syrian city of Idlib close to the Turkish border, but was shot down during the operation.

Sufhan, ejected from the plane, receiving several bone fractures and face injuries. He was rescued during a search operation and admitted to a hospital in Turkey's Hatay province.

Syrian state media said on Saturday its forces had been expanding control over former Islamic State-held villages in northwest Syria, an area close to Turkey's Hatay region where the aircraft crashed.

Anti-war activists unfurled a giant banner at the White Helmets pop-up concert at NY's Grand Central reading: ""U.S.A. OUT OF EVERYWHERE"" 

A pop-up music concert in New York's Grand Central station, promoting the work of the Oscar-winning Syrian ""humanitarian"" group White Helmets, was disrupted by anti-war protesters.
While a full orchestra and choir, some wearing white helmets, pounded out Beethoven's Ode to Joy against the backdrop of Grand Central Station in Manhattan on Friday, about a dozen anti-war activists protested the group's presence.

Activists said:

""We were there because the White Helmets are a PR effort for the US government to drum up support for intervention in Syria. We are opposed to US intervention in Syria and everywhere else, we thought it was important to protest this event,"" .

""It was bad, because they were taking a very beautiful and well-known music and basically trying to drum up war propaganda and sentiment to justify the war when in fact that the US has bases in Syria, the US has already invaded Syria, US is already responsible for the protracted war against the Syrian people. Half of the country are refugees,"" Another activist told RT. ""And they want to give you Beethoven's Ninth [Symphony]. That's sick.""

""All you have to do is look at their funding source – which is the US government – specifically the USAID, and the UK foreign office have given tens of millions of dollars to this group which is run by the Syria Civil Defense, which is a PR firm,"" independent journalist Rania Khalek told RT. ""The purpose of all this is to push for regime change in the public sphere. To paint a narrative that pushes for escalation and military intervention in Syria. ""

In a press conference held on Friday evening in Geneva, de Mistura said that a clear agenda for the talks was reach and it includes four baskets, including the counter-terrorism basket which was added based on the request of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation and which involves strategy for fighting terrorism, noting that agreement was reached on a methodology for addressing the four baskets in a parallel manner.

The Envoy said that he expects the sides to move forward with implementing a framework agreement that contains a political package for the negotiations which should lead to implementing Security Council resolution no. 2254, elaborating by saying that the four baskets in the agenda consist of one on establishing credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance within six months, one that includes other issues that he hopes are also achieved in six months for setting a timetable, one for holding elections after drafting a constitution within 18 months, and the fourth and final basket is for counter-terrorism.

De Mistura said that the Astana and Geneva efforts complement each other and that he supports the ceasefire mechanism, adding that he seeks to facilitate other issues like humanitarian access and releasing prisoners.

He pointed out that although the goal was to reach direct dialogue in Astana and Geneva, they noticed that indirect negotiations might be better, noting that he noticed that progress has been made in this round of talks and that there's need for a single opposition delegation, adding that he will continue efforts in this direction.

The Envoy said that he will update the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on what happened in Geneva, and based on the indications they will give, he intends to invite the participants to a fifth round of talks in March.

He also affirmed that the idea of there being a military option in Syria is a fantasy, as the solution can only be a political one that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people.

De Mistura said that he feels that all sides are ready for dialogue and this is what's important, and that he feels that there's forward momentum.

On a relevant note, head of the delegation of the ""Moscow platform"" opposition group Hamza Munzir said in a press conference after meeting de Mistura that including the counter-terrorism basket in the agenda is essential for the platform, stressing the need to form a single opposition delegation removed from ""hegemony or recklessness.""

In a similar press conference, head of the delegation of the ""Cairo platform"" Jihad Makdesi said that the delegation accepted the procedural statement distributed by de Mistura among the delegations and accepted in principle adding any basket as long as progress is made in parallel and the result is announced as a single package, adding that the platform reached a coordination mechanism with the ""Riyadh delegation.""

The 4th round of intra-Syrian talks in Geneva began on February 23rd.

The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces announced on Thursday that units of army re-established control over the city of Tadmur (Palmyra) after inflicting heavy losses upon #ISIS terrorist organization in personnel and equipment.

The Army's Command said in a statement that the army units, in cooperation with the allied and backing forces, re-established control over the city of Tadmur (Palmyra) and the areas surrounding it following a series of successful military operations, supported by the #Syrian and #Russian air forces.

It added that the engineering units meantime are dismantling IEDs planted by terrorists before they were expelled.

The General Command affirmed that the importance of this achievement lies in the historic and civilized status of the city of Palmyra and its synchronization with the victories of the Syrian Arab Army in the northeastern countryside to the city of Aleppo which dealt a severe blow to ISIS terrorist organization that began to collapse under the strikes of the army.

He went on to say that this achievement confirms that the Syrian Arab Army, in collaboration with friends, is the only active force to fight terrorism and eradicate it, adding that the restoration of Tadmur  is a basis to expand the military operations against ISIS on many axes and to tighten the grip around the terrorists and break off their supply routes.

The Army Command affirmed that the Syrian army, in cooperation with the allied and supporting forces, is determined to continue its operations against ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and the other terrorist organizations until restoring security and stability to every inch of the homeland.

Carlos Martinez: ""Had the pleasure of meeting #Vanessa_Beeley and hearing her presentation at Marx Memorial Library in London yesterday - it was very informative and moving. Most of all, it gave voice to ordinary #Syrians suffering from six years of a devastating war that has been imposed on them by the imperialist powers and their lunatic proxies. The voices of these ordinary Syrians are heard nowhere in the mainstream media; they have been silenced and marginalised, because their message doesn't fit into a narrative supporting regime change.

Vanessa deserves credit for her work and her courage. She faces enormous hostility for countering the mainstream narrative. The #Syria_Solidarity_UK group organised a little 'direct action' at yesterday's meeting: two of their members tried to break the event up by dropping stink bombs; meanwhile they held a picket outside, using a megaphone to try and shout Vanessa down. It struck me that, given all their talk about wanting to bring 'freedom' to Syria and put an end to 'dictatorship', their tactics are startlingly similar to those used by the fascist brownshirts in 1920s Germany. 

Nobody denies *them* freedom of speech; nobody tries to break up *their* meetings. Yet they are apparently so scared of what Vanessa has to say (itself almost entirely based on video interviews with actual Syrians) that they try to shut her up. It's despicable. Syria Solidarity UK brings no solidarity to Syrians; it brings solidarity to death squads; it portrays terrorists as revolutionaries; it supports western military intervention in the form of a no-fly zone on a Libya model. It uses the language of liberation, but it favours imperialism, sectarianism, terrorism and oppression. It should be thoroughly exposed.""

 24 Feb 2017 

Turkish armed forces and allied Free Syria Army (#FSA) terrorist group have completely taken the Islamic State bastion of al-Bab in northern Syria from jihadists, the military said Friday.

""As of February 24, 2017, control of all neighbourhoods in al-Bab have been secured. Activities continue to clear areas under control of obstacles, mines and hand-made explosives,"" the army said in a statement.

However, some sources claimed that Islamic State withdrew militants from al-Bab after negotiations. Al-Bab is also being targeted by the Syrian army. The Turkish-backed terrorist groups are racing to seize al-Bab before rival Syrian army forces arrive. 

Turkey launched its unilateral military operation last August supporting Syrian opposition fighters, targeting IS as well as Syrian Kurdish militia.

The US military planes have helped the ISIL terrorists in Tal Afar region West of Mosul, eyewitnesses disclosed.
""We saw several packages dropped out of a US army aircraft in the surrounding areas of the city of Tal Afar in Western Nineveh province and six people also came out of a US plane in the ISIL-controlled areas,"" the Arabic-language media quoted a number of eyewitnesses as saying on Wednesday.

Tal Afar city has been under the siege of the Iraqi volunteer forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) for about two months now and the efforts by the ISIL terrorists to help their comrades besieged in Tal Afar have failed so far.

The news comes as the Iraqi army had reported that the US air force has been helping the ISIL terrorists in areas controlled by the terrorist group. The Iraqi army says that the US army is trying to transfer the ISIL commanders trapped in areas besieged by the Iraqi army to safe regions.

In relevant remarks in late January, a senior commander of the Iraqi popular forces in Hamreen region disclosed that the US helicopters have helped the ISIL terrorists in Hamreen mountains in several nighttime operations during the past several weeks.

""The White Helmets are a ""feel good"" story like a Disney hero movie: 90% myth and fabrication. Most of what is claimed about the Syrian rescue group is untrue."" 
--
""Most of the heavy funding goes to the marketing which is run by ""The Syria Campaign"" based in New York. The manager is an Irish America woman Anna Nolan who has never been to Syria. As an example of its deception, ""The Syria Campaign"" website features video showing children dancing and playing soccer implying they are part of the opposition demand for a ""free and peaceful"" Syria . But the video images are taken from a 2010 BBC documentary about education in Syria under the Baath government.""
--
""The movie is as fraudulent as the group it tries to heroize. The film-makers never set foot in Syria. Their video footage takes place in southern Turkey where they show White Helmet trainees in a hotel and talking on cell phones. Thrilling. There is some footage from inside Syria but it looks contrived.""

""We are certain that the positive experience gained in Astana will be capitalized on in the future,"" Zakharova said in a press briefing on Wednesday, adding ""we expect that the talks in Geneva due later this week will end the dangerous prolonged pause in the intra-Syrian dialogue.""

She stressed that ensuring proper representation of the Syrian opposition, as it is required by the UN Security Council's Resolution 2254, is a precondition for intra-Syrian dialogue and its productiveness, adding ""any attempts to cheat somewhere to cater to the interests of those who do not wish to see peace and unity in Syria will have a bad effect on the continuity and productiveness of the political process.""

Zakharova confirmed that Sergei Vershinin, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special envoy for the Middle East settlement and head of the Middle East and North Africa department, will represent Moscow at the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva.

On another note, she affirmed that the Russian armed forces will go ahead with providing support for the Syrian Army in its battle against ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.""

A prominent Syrian analyst warned that Ankara still has strong ties with the leaders of the terrorist groups in Syria, including the ISIL and al-Nusra (Fatah al-Sham) Front.

""Ankara has sent the terrorists from different parts of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama to the Northeastern parts of Aleppo to fight in the Euphrates Shield Operation,"" Rizzan Haddu told FNA on Saturday.

""Meantime, Ankara has some relations with the ISIL and al-Nusra too,"" he added.

Haddu underlined that if Turkey, supported by the NATO, were serious about the establishment of peace in Syria, it would not implement special plots in Syria and there would be no need to holding Geneva talks and negotiations with the militants.

Ankara has backed militants fighting against President Bashar al-Assad since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011.

Turkey declared on August 24 that its Army has launched 'Euphrates Shield' military operation in Syria, as Ankara claims that it has begun to cleanse the ISIL terrorists from its border with the Arab country.

But, despite Ankara's allegation, Turkish military forces support militant groups in Northern Syria, and fight against Kurdish forces in the region.

Turkish officials have frequently stressed that operation 'Euphrates Shield' will continue to create a safe zone in Northern Syria, as demanded by US President Donald Trump.

Damascus had condemned Ankara's military operation and entry of Turkish special forces and tanks into Syria, while Moscow expressed deep concern about what is happening in the Syrian-Turkish border area.

A CIA report on Syria has written in 1986 presents clues regarding the riots began in 2011 and its aftermath. In the report, CIA emphasises that ''a Sunni regime controlled by business-oriented moderates'' would ideally serve for US interests

It has not yet been possible to learn the whole role of the United States in the ""regime change"" operations began in Syria in 2011.

However, a report within the CIA's declassified documents during previous weeks allows us to forge a link between the scenarios predicted by the American intelligence for Syria in the 1980s and today's situation in Syria.

The memo dated July 1986 and entitled ""Syria: Scenarios of Dramatic Political Change"" was prepared by CIA only for high-level officials of the Ronald Reagan administration.

The report essentially considers possible scenarios that could lead to the ouster of Hafez Al-Assad, who was Syria's President from 1971 to 2000, Prime Minister from 1970 to 71, or other dramatic changes in Syria.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 1986

Before reviewing the context of the report, it should be reminded that 1986 was a crucial year for Syria and the region as well.   

1986 was a year that Hafez Al-Assad's government in Syria was once again suppressed through an international isolation and a year that various terrorist attacks took place domestically.  

The scenario, known as the Hindawi affair, which would result in the bombing of a plane by the Syrian intelligence, left Syria in a very difficult situation. Although it was claimed that this incident was a conspiracy organised by Mossad (the national intelligence agency of Israel) in order to put the Syria behind the eight ball, the arrow had already left the bow.

In March and April of the same year, five cities of Syria were shaken by bomb attacks, and more than 200 civilians lost their lives in the events.

The claim has been spoken over the years until today that at the end of 1985, the meeting of the Colonel Oliver North from the US National Security Council and Amiram Nir the counter-terrorism advisor of Shimon Peres, who was the prime minister of Israel at that period, triggered terrorist incidents in Syria.

A SECTARIAN WAR IN SYRIA

The intelligence report considers the insurrection of the Muslim Brotherhood between the years 1979-1982 as a Sunni challenge.

By 1986, the CIA, which predicted that a second ""Sunni challenge"" is unlikely, says that ""an excessive government reaction to minor outbreaks might trigger large-scale unrest.""

The CIA reporting ""in most instances the regime would have the resources to crush a Sunni opposition movement"", believes that along with it, widespread violence may pave the way for a civil war by forcing the large numbers of Sunni officers in the army to flee or mutiny.

The report asserts that although the Sunnis carve out 60 percent of the armed forces, they are concentrated in junior ranks. From this point of view, the American intelligence believes that the Sunnis in the army will turn against the Syrian government in case of the resurrection of the violence between the Alevis and Sunnis in Syria.

THE ROLE OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN THE REGIME CHANGE   

In the CIA report, the Muslim Brotherhood is given an extensive role in a possible regime change.

Although the report considers a regime change under the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood as a long-term scenario, one of the three scenarios projected for the ouster of the ruling Ba'ath Party, is still the Muslim Brotherhood insurrection (the other two scenarios are the power struggles among the successors of Assad, and the possibility of sparking a coup d'etat by the military reverses).

The CIA, saying the Muslim Brotherhood's armed opposition was drastically crushed in 1982, judges that there is still a potential for another Sunni opposition movement.

Indicating that the role of the Muslim Brotherhood between 1979-1982 was ""to exploit and orchestrate opposition activity by other organised groups"", the CIA reports that these groups still exist, and they might coalesce into an extensive movement under a proper leadership.

For the leadership of these groups and a new Sunni opposition movement, the CIA thinks young professionals who formed the militant faction of the Muslim Brotherhood and the remnants of the Brotherhood.

In the report, it is stated that even though Assad has crushed the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1980s, ''Sunni opposition'' fell into deep as small fractions, while the CIA claims that a sectarian conflict may begin, if the government mistakenly considers the small protests as a ''resurgence of the Muslim Brotherhood'', and violently suppressed them.

The CIA argues that excessive use of force by the government to these small protests might be seen by the Sunnis as ""an evidence of a government vendetta against all Sunnis"".

Similar to the confidential CIA report suggested to make covert US operations and arms aid for the Sunni opposition through using Iraq as a base, it is determined that the Sunni opposition in Syria might be supplied by Iraq in a case of a possible civil war.

A SUNNI REGIME SERVING THE INTERESTS OF THE WEST

Although the report fundamentally focuses on the possibilities that can overthrow the Assad's administration, it also delivers an opinion about the question of which one of these scenarios best serves the US interests.

At the end of the preface of the report, it is admitted that one of the desired outcomes for the US is the Sunni regime in Syria.

According to the CIA, a Sunni regime controlled by business-oriented moderates is the form of government that would best serve the US interests.

The CIA's report also claims that business moderates would see a strong need for Western aid and investment to build Syria's private economy, and added that these factors would open the way for stronger ties to Western governments.

AN ISLAMIC STATE IN DAMASCUS

An interesting evaluation in the CIA report, as it can be seen in the contemporary Syria, is the possibility of a religious state that could seek to establish in a case of the ouster of Assad.

The CIA warns that ""religious zealots might seek to establish an Islamic republic"" if the Ba'ath state structure collapses.

 17 Feb, 2017

The Syrian Foreign Ministry has condemned Turkey's ""repeated crimes and attacks"" on the Syrian people as well as violations of Syrian sovereignty and territorial integrity, in two letters to the UN, Syria's SANA news agency reports.

The ministry expressed its discontent with Turkey's actions in letters sent to the UN secretary general and the current president of the UN Security Council.

In the letters, the Syrian authorities ask the UNSC to exert influence on Ankara and force it to put an end to ""repeated crimes and attacks against the Syrian people and violations of the sanctity and unity of Syria's territory,"" SANA writes.

Damascus says that Turkey's ""aggression against Syria"" has continued for five years and involves ""providing various forms of military, material and logistic support to the terrorist organizations and facilitating the entry of foreign militants into Syria.""

The Syrian Foreign Ministry again demanded that the UNSC fulfill its responsibilities to preserve international peace and security.

The statement comes a day after SANA reported that 24 people, including 11 children aged under six and eight women, were killed in Turkish airstrikes and shelling of the northern Syrian town of Al Bab.

The news agency said it just the latest in a series of similar attacks carried out by the Turkish military in the Al Bab region. 
On January 11, nine people were reported killed and 57 injured in Turkish attacks on the towns of Al Bab, Baza'a and Tadef, while two Turkish attacks on Al Bab in late December 2016 reportedly claimed the lives of 88 civilians in total.

16 Feb 2017

President Bashar al-Assad affirmed that victory in Aleppo is an important step in the way to defeat and to eliminate the terrorism from our country, adding ""we don't think that we can talk about winning the war unless we defeat the terrorists everywhere in Syria.""

The president added in an interview given to French TF1 TV and EUROPE 1 Radio that the west supported terrorists in Syria under the name of ""moderate,"" but it was supporting the same basis of al-Qaeda and ISIS.

Following is the full text of the interview:

Journalist: President Bashar al-Assad, thank for accepting this encounter with TF1 and with Europe 1 here in Damascus. We're going to speak about the future of Syria, about the war on terror, about the recent gains and support that you can count on, as well as the heavy accusations you're still facing.

Journalist: Good morning, Mr. President, bonjour monsieur le président.

President Assad: Good morning.

Question 1: A simple question to start with: after the fall of Aleppo two months ago, can one say that you have won the war?

President Assad: No, we don't think that we can talk about winning the war unless we defeat the terrorists everywhere in Syria. It's just an important step in the way to defeat and to eliminate the terrorism from our country, but I think it's going to be a long way for one reason, a simple reason; because they still have the support of many Western countries including France, including UK, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Qatar in our region.

Question 2: You talk about a long way; can you summarize from a military point of view the objectives that you have still to reach?

President Assad: Definitely, when I talk about eliminating the terrorists from our country, it means to take over every inch of our country, to bring it back under the control of the government, and that's the duty of any government; is to take control of every place.

Question 3: In which part of Syria particularly, which town?

President Assad: You mean next after Aleppo?

Journalist: Yes.

President Assad: Of course, now you have to, and we are, we continue our campaign in the area surrounding Aleppo, just to make Aleppo more immune against any other terrorist attacks from the western and northern part that's been supported by Turkey directly, by the Turkish army.

Question 4: But the next step is Idleb? This is what people say; next big battle will be Idleb.

President Assad: Could be Idleb, could be Raqqa, could be anywhere. Now, it depends on the situation on daily basis, because you change your plans. So, we didn't put that plan before finishing Aleppo as city and rural area. So, it's still early to talk about which is next. That depends on the development of the battles in the different areas.

Question 5: But the situation is far better off now for you as it used to be, militarily speaking.

President Assad: Of course, every place you can liberate from the terrorists means the situation is better, but it's not enough for us.

Question 6: Sir, for France, the main terrorist threat is Daesh, there's no question about this. For you, all armed groups, or most of them, are terrorists. Why is Daesh not a specific threat for you?

President Assad: Let me answer you about two points: the first one, it's not for us, when we say they are terrorists, not for us as government; it's for the law, and for the international law. Whoever carries a machinegun in my country or in your country and starts killing people and destroying properties is a terrorist. This is an international concept, so it's not for us. For us, whoever wants to give up his armament is not a terrorist anymore, according to the law. But if you talk about Daesh, I think when you say that the French people or the Europeans worry about Daesh, I think this is misunderstanding of the situation; Daesh is a product, it's not the problem. The problem is the ideology of Daesh, which is the same for al-Nusra, the same for many other organizations, like-minded organizations in Syria, and maybe in Libya or any other country. So, you should be worried about those terrorists; they don't care about being ISIS or al-Nusra, they implement what their ideology is telling them to do, mainly terrorist acts.

Question 7: So, there's no difference between Daesh and the other groups?

President Assad: Definitely, in Syria the grassroots are the same; the same people who were in ISIS were before in al-Nusra, now they are moving from organization to organization, because it's the same ideology: it's Wahabi ideology, this is the source of this terrorism.

Question 8: This is the same enemy for you, all the terrorists are the same?

President Assad: Yeah, of course, according to the law, not for me. As I said, according to the law and the international law, no-one has the right to hold armaments except the army and the police in any country. I think the same in France, unless I'm wrong, you can tell me, but that's what I think, everywhere in the world.

Question 9: So, Raqqa, which is the heartland of Daesh, where the terror attacks in France were prepared, Raqqa is not a priority target for you?

President Assad: No, again, they're not necessarily prepared in Raqqa. Raqqa is a symbol of ISIS.

Journalist: It's a symbol.

President Assad: You have ISIS close to Damascus, you have them everywhere, you have them in Palmyra now, you have them in the eastern part of Syria, so no, it's not about al-Raqqa; everywhere is a priority, depending on the development of the battle, but for us all the same: Raqqa, Palmyra, Idleb; all the same.

Question 10: Sir, you present yourself as the main shield against terrorism. There's a lot of people, in the West in particular, would think that ISIS on the one hand and your regime on the other hand are the two sides, the two faces of a same evil trying to crush any form of democratic and free expression in this country. What would you answer to them? It's a real question.

President Assad: First of all, we're not a regime; we are a state, institutions. Second one, that's the demonization of the Western mainstream media and political strata regarding Syria and the Syrian government and Syrian army, because they supported those ""moderates"" at the very beginning, and at the beginning they said they are ""peaceful demonstrators,"" then they said ""they're not peaceful, they are fighters but they are moderate,"" but they couldn't recognize that they were supporting the same grassroots of Al Qaeda and ISIS. That's why they say that we are trying to promote those terrorists and to use them as alternative so the West cannot choose. First of all, the West doesn't have to choose between me and ISIS: my people have to choose, because this is a Syrian issue, to be frank with you. So, we don't care about what the Western officials think about this; they have to worry about their people and to protect their people from the terrorist attacks that's been happening because of their policies.

Question 11: Sir, of course we are extremely shocked, particularly in France, by the horror of terrorism, but we are also horrified by a report from Amnesty International released a few days ago, last week. It's about the prison of Sednaya. It's not far from here, not far from Damas. 13,000 executed prisoners, massive hangings, torture. Amnesty speaks – I read the report – of a place where the Syrian state silently slaughters its own people, the Syrian state, your government. Mr. President, is everything permitted in order to win the war? Can you do everything that you want?

President Assad: No, everything legal. You cannot do anything…

Journalist: But according to Amnesty report, seems to be illegal.

President Assad: No. There's difference between me and you talking about facts in this… in Syria, or talking about allegations. If you want to talk about allegations, we can spend the time talking about allegations, never-ending allegations. Anyone can say whatever he wants, and we can discuss it, but in that case, we're not going to talk about facts. But if you want to talk about Amnesty, because Amnesty is known around the world, it's shameful for such an organization to build a report on allegations. If you take any allegations to a court in your country, you have court, you have judicial system, could they take any decision regarding allegations, or they have to look for the evidence? This report is built on allegations, not a single shred of documents, not a single evidence. They didn't say 13,000; they said between 5,000 and 13, which is double and half the number, it means it's not precise. There's no mentioning of names, of anyone who is from the victims; only 36 out of those thousands, and there are many flaws. They said, for example, the Grand Mufti is endorsing the execution. The religious figures in Syria has nothing to do with any judicial process. The execution in Syria is legal, it's part of the law since the independence, so the government can execute anyone legally; why to do it illegally?

Journalist: You can tell us that there's no torture in the prison of Sednaya as Amnesty said?

President Assad: The question is torture for what? I mean, if you want to say that we are committing torture, for what? What do I get? Why? Just for sadism? We are sadists? What is it for? I mean, to get information? We have all the information, so we don't use it, it's not our policy, because for a simple reason: if we commit such atrocities, it's going to play into the hands of the terrorists, they're going to win. It's about winning the hearts of the Syrian people. If we committed such atrocities at any stage of this conflict, we wouldn't have the support after six years. It's a very simple fact. But again, if you go back to the reports, reports should be built on fact. There's not a single fact in that report, and they have to prove it, they cannot.

Question 12: But Amnesty is suggesting to send international observers to the detention centers in Syria, to get some proof, or to prove that you're right, and that there's no crime being committed. What's your answer to this proposal?

President Assad: I think we need an investigation on the Amnesty itself, when they adopt a report based on allegations. This is a shame, shame on such an organization that has never been impartial, it's always biased.

Journalist: Testimonies of former guards and prisoners?

President Assad: It's about the sovereignty. If you have allegations every day and reports every day, you can spend the time receiving delegations. Would you accept now, if you ask your government, to send a Syrian delegation to investigate why your army, through Sarkozy and later Hollande, attacked the Libyans and killed tens or hundreds of thousands? Can we go investigate the money that Sarkozy got from the Libyan leader? It's a matter of sovereignty. No, we're not going to allow Amnesty to be here, for any reason. I'm not talking about that report, but you have to – as mainstream media – investigate; that report is based on what? Just allegations? You don't take it seriously.

Journalist: So, your answer is no to the visit of international observers.

President Assad: Definitely, no, no. We don't care about such a childish report based on nothing, just allegations. And they said they interviewed a few witnesses who are opposition and defected, so it's a biased report.

Question 13: But you acknowledge that there are some executions, numerous executions, official, legal executions in Syria, going on.

President Assad: Since the independence, you have it, since the independence. It's part of the Syrian law, execution, if there's a killing act, there is execution. So, it's not about the crisis, not about that report, it's not about that prison. You have legal ways to do it, and it's a judicial way.

Question 14: Sir, let's talk about relation between France and Syria. In a few weeks from now, a new president will be elected in France, and among the debates we have in our country there is the issue of resuming dialogue with your government. Do you hope for the renewal of diplomatic relations with France?

President Assad: It's not about the diplomatic relations. First of all, it's about the policy of France. So, if we don't have this diplomatic relation, it's not that big problem for the time being now. Maybe in the long-term, you need to have good relations with any country, including diplomatic relations.

Journalist: So, let's talk about the policy of France.

President Assad: Exactly. The policy of France, that started from day one, to support the terrorists in Syria, and is responsible directly of the killings in our country.

Journalist: How can you say it… it's a serious accusation against France. How can you say that France is supporting terrorism?

President Assad: They said, I didn't accuse them. They said, many times, they supported the war, and Hollande recently said it was a mistake not to launch war in 2013. They said that they send armaments to whom they call ""moderate"" groups, which are terrorists. They said that, I didn't say. The Americans said the same, the French said the same. So, your officials – go back to their statements during the last two, three, four years, maybe – you have more than one self-accusation by the French officials.

Question 15: Francois Hollande is about to leave the power in France. You're still there. Did you win your struggle, your arm-wrestling with Francois Hollande?

President Assad: It's not between me and him, it's not something personal, I never met him, I don't care about him, to be frank, and his popularity is 11 percent recently, which is rock-bottom, I think, for any president in the history of France. Actually, it's between me and the terrorists, and between me and whoever supports the terrorists. Till this moment, the terrorists couldn't win the war, but they've been destroying Syria, they killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians, so I cannot say I won the war. They didn't succeed in their plan, but till this moment we haven't finished our war, so I cannot say that I won the war.

Question 16: Do you have any contacts… do you follow, first of all the French political campaign, the presidential campaign going on right now?

President Assad: We follow it in general, not in details, because we don't bet on the Western elections for one reason, a simple reason; that we don't take the Western officials at their word during the campaign, because they say something for the voters, not for the sake of the country, for the voters to go and vote. This is reality, I'm being frank with you.

Question 17: Sir, you see, even the difference between the right wing and the left wing in France considering relation with Syria, you see a difference?

President Assad: Yes, you can feel it, but at the end whoever becomes president, what's his policy going to be? The same as we used to see it as rhetoric before the elections, or what? That's the question. So, it's not something you bet on. Of course, you prefer somebody who doesn't take the position of warmonger, you prefer it, but you don't know…

Journalist: For example, who do you think, who is the best one who doesn't want war?

President Assad: We don't see any big difference now, but again, I wouldn't bet on their rhetoric. Regarding rhetoric, there's no big difference.

Question 18: And do you have some contacts with some of the candidates? None of them?

President Assad: No, we don't have any contacts with any of them.

Journalist: And with intelligence service?

President Assad: In some cases, we had some indirect contacts.

Journalist: With French intelligence service?

President Assad: Yes.

Journalist: You personally, you have contact with intelligence service?

President Assad: Actually, in one of the delegations that came to Syria, it was parliamentarian, one from the intelligence was part of the delegation. So, it's involved. Of course, the French government said ""they are parliamentary delegation, we're not involved, we don't agree,"" which is not true. Of course, we have so many channels.

Question 19: A country already changed its president; that is the United States. One of the first contested decisions of Donald Trump is the Muslim ban. It intended to forbid citizens from some Muslim countries, including Syria, to travel to US. As a Syrian citizen, as president of Syria, do you feel some humiliation there?

President Assad: No, no, because it's not against the Syrian people, first of all, it's against the terrorists that could infiltrate some of the immigrants to the West, and that happened; happened in Europe, mainly in Germany, and it could happen in the United States. So, I think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming, so he took it this way. Second…

Journalist: So, he's in the right way, when he…

President Assad: No, no, I'm talking about something we can disagree or agree on as persons, but for me as president, I wouldn't worry about that. I'm worried about how can I bring the Syrian people to Syria, not to send them to the United States. I wouldn't feel happy if they could access other countries, I will feel happy when they can come back to Syria, because they want to come back to Syria, the majority of the Syrians left because of the terrorism and the embargo, the Western embargo. So, if I want to deal with that decision, I would ask Trump and the Western countries to lift the embargo and to stop supporting the terrorists. They wouldn't have problem with this. They won't have immigrants or terrorists infiltrating the immigrants. Second, this is another important point, all the fuss that we heard about Trump's decisions is not because they are worried about the Syrians or about any other countries; it's because they want to use our cause, our problem, our conflict, as the fuel for their conflict with Trump, because you have other decisions that have been taken by Obama few months ago regarding the same issue, the mainstream media in the United States didn't talk about it; it only talked about Trump when he announced it publicly and he took it in a stark way.

Question 20: So, you feel more comfortable, you, with Donald Trump than with Mr. Barack Obama?

President Assad: No, I cannot feel comfortable unless I see his policy towards Syria; I haven't seen it yet. So, again we have to be cautious with every Western leader because they can say something and do the opposite, and then they can say something… do something in the morning and do the opposite in the evening. They wouldn't commit to anything; they are very pragmatic till they sell their values, they don't have values in their policies.

Question 21: But at least there is one thing that didn't change so far, is this sort of disengagement of the US from the region, this is pretty obvious. A second round of negotiations is starting now in Astana, in Kazakhstan, and it's very striking; the Western countries are totally out of the game, they're out of the picture. Is this really good for the future of the negotiations and the future of peace in the region?

President Assad: No, the more support you have for any political process, the better, but the Western countries that been involved in those processes, mainly France and UK, lost the chance of achieving anything in Geneva, twice; two rounds in Geneva and they couldn't achieve anything because they supported those groups that represented the terrorists against the government. They didn't want to achieve peace in Syria; they wanted to achieve their goals through the peace axis of the whole process.

Question 22: But the fact that the destiny of the Middle East is supervised right now by two countries, Iran and Russia, that by the way don't have a fantastic democratic record of their own, is that a good thing?

President Assad: Again, the more involvement you have around the world, the better, and that's not only our vision; that's even the Russian vision, and the Russians invited many countries to come and help them in fighting terrorism and supporting this political process, but the Western countries isolated themselves, not Iran, not Russia. They were very passive in dealing with all these initiatives, like Astana; where are they? Did the Russians tell them not to come? No, they didn't. They didn't come.

Journalist: So, Iran and Russia are promoters of peace, and the Western countries of war?

President Assad: Exactly, a hundred percent, hundred percent.

Question 23: Let's continue to talk about Russia. Would you say that Vladimir Putin is finally the real decision-maker in the region and even in your country, in Syria?

President Assad: No, no, he's not. We are the decision-maker regarding Syria. Regarding other countries, I cannot talk on behalf of the others. They respect our sovereignty; every step they took, whether strategic step or tactical step, it was in cooperation with Syria. They never did take a single step without us. They base their politics on values and on their interests, especially regarding fighting terrorism. So, no, it's our decision.

Question 24: But would you say that without Russia, your government would have collapsed a long time ago?

President Assad: This is a hypothetical question; nobody can tell you about the war because it's in fluctuation. Of course, which is definite for everyone, that without the Russian support, it would have been worse. How much worse? I cannot tell you, no-one can tell you. Collapsed, withstood, I cannot tell you, but definitely, the Russian support was very crucial in order for ISIS and al-Nusra to re-shrink; because they were expanding after the American alliance started its attacks, cosmetic campaign in Syria, they were expanding till the Russians intervened, they started shrinking. This is reality. This is a fact.

Question 25: Are you stricken by the fact that a few years ago, most of the observers and analysts were saying that you wouldn't last very long in power, and especially after Aleppo, now the possibility that you may stay is agreed by a large number of people. So, the question is, the question about you remaining in power, this is a question also in Astana in the negotiations. In our country, when a political man has a bad record, usually, usually he doesn't stay in power very long time. After seventeen years in power, six years of war, three hundred thousand plus dead in this country, a destroyed and divided country, would you say from a moral perspective, not a legal one, a moral perspective, that this record allows you to remain in power, whatever the outcome of the negotiations might be?

President Assad: You know about that terrorists who committed the recent attacks in France last year, and then the police killed some of them, you know about that. What do you go to tell that policeman? Do you tell him you're a killer or a savior? He killed. The same for a doctor who could take out a leg because there is gangrene in the leg. Would you tell him you committed atrocity, or you saved the life of the patient? So, it's about the reason why you commit an act, this is first. And in our case, we were fighting the terrorists to protect the people. It's not my point of view; it's a duty according to the constitution and to the law. If I don't do that, I would be the killer, because I will allow the terrorists to kill more Syrians in Syria, and that's the duty of your army to protect the French, otherwise, they will say ""no, we don't do anything, because they call us a killer.""

Question 26: So, you would say eventually that you have done everything you could and you should for your country?

President Assad: What I could?Definitely. What I should? The Syrian people say, would say what I should have done, because we have different points of view. But regarding who's going to say this is a bad record when you talk about the moral part of your question, it's only related to the Syrian people, not the European officials to say this is bad record or good record. They were talking about ""Assad must go,"" now they don't talk about ""Assad must go."" I don't care about either. I never cared about this, since the very beginning. I care about our war against the terrorism, about fighting their plans to destroy our country. That's my worry since the beginning. That's why it's the same for me whatever they say. The record is a Syrian record, not a European record by any means.

Question 27: But when Syrian people can say if they approve or not your policy?  We have election in France now, when is the next one in Syria?

President Assad: You have two means: the current means and the one that comes in the future at the end of the war. That time, you can talk about any means, whether you have ballot box, you have elections, you have anything. In the meantime, the people can have one means: either to support you or not. After six years of the war, if that president has bad record according to the Syrian people, why would they support him? A simple question: why do they have to support him? Why they didn't they support the terrorists? And according to that question when you talk about three hundred thousand or four hundred thousand killed, and you talk about the president killing them, it's like you're giving the terrorists a certificate of good behavior because we are killing the people and they are protecting the people; Al Qaeda and al-Nusra and ISIS are protecting the people. So, this is the content of that question. Actually, no, we are fighting for the Syrian people. That's why the Syrian people supported their government and their army and their president.

Journalist: Thank you Mr. President for receiving Europe 1 and TF1.

President Assad: Thank you very much for coming.

'Echoes of failure: West shot itself in the foot over Syria'

The West was confident the Assad government would fall, but it didn't happen because it has retained a very solid base of support within the Syrian population, says anti-war activist Richard Becker from the ANSWER Coalition.

Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the UK and the country's ex-Deputy Foreign Minister, accused the West of failure in Syria in response to a question from RT Deutsch. 
He said Western governments had no real plan how to remove Syrian President Bashar Assad when they were calling for his removal.

RT: What do you think of Ischinger's comments that the West has ""shot itself in the foot"" over Syria by insisting Assad goes but without having a proper plan for his removal?

Richard Becker: They are the echoes of failure. The West, in particular, the US, British, French governments, the Turkish government, the Saudi government and others, they were all confident in summer 2011 the Assad-led government would fall. They said so over and over again. They said it was just a matter of time. It didn't happen. And it didn't happen because the government has retained a very solid base of support within the population of Syria. Even before it was getting assistance from outside, it was somewhat able to stabilize the situation under very difficult circumstances. But the idea that the West did not intervene enough, that Turkey didn't intervene enough, Britain, France, the US, and Qatar, and other Gulf monarchies - supposedly in the name of the democracy, I would add parenthetically - didn't do enough is just a ridiculous statement. They did a great deal to try to bring down the government; to destroy Syria in the way they destroyed Libya. That intervention is really unforgivable.

RT: The West has repeatedly insisted that Assad must go, but did Western leaders ever have a serious plan to remove Assad?

RB: They believe that what they were doing, in their towering imperial arrogance, and you can hear it in the voices [of some leaders.] They were quite confident that they were succeeding; that all of the foreign fighters going in through Turkey, all the weaponry that was coming in from Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, all the training and weaponry that was coming directly from the CIA – from the US, from the former colonizers of the region – Britain and France. The idea that they didn't do anything, they didn't have an effective plan – they believed that they were going to succeed.

They believed the government and state in Syria was going to collapse under all of their pressure, and that was a great deal of pressure. But because of the Iraq war particularly the US was not in a position, Obama did not believe, he was not in a position to launch an all-out war against Syria, to send in ground troops, or even to establish a no-fly zone, although, he came very close to that in September 2013. Again, they were quite confident that their very energetic efforts were going to bring down the government, and they failed.
 
RT: Officials have insisted coalition operations were conducted with great care, so as not to cause civilian casualties. However, we've seen a lot of civilian casualties after US-led coalition air strikes. What can we read into that?

RB: They always claim that. They have been claiming it for decades now – all the way back to the Vietnam War. In Iraq it was all precision weaponry, and it wasn't, and it isn't, and it really can't be. Many of the attacks were directly on civilian areas, and the airstrikes that were carried out in many, many parts of Syria inflicted a great deal of death and destruction, and you would think from the Western media reports, that all the causalities in Syria have been at the hands of the Syrian government. In fact, that is very, very far from true. It is not that the Syrian government hasn't its army, hasn't also inflicted some civilian causalities, there is no question about that. But probably a quarter of all the deaths in Syria have been Syrian Arab Army causalities.

The Syrian government denies categorically the false allegations brought up in the report of the Human Rights Watch (HRW) that the Syrian forces and their allies used toxic substances in the operation to liberate #Aleppo, an official source at the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry said on Wednesday.

""The fact that the Human Rights Watch organization relied on the terrorists' media sources and on absolutely non-credible false witnesses proves the lack of credibility of the report,"" the source said in a statement to SANA.

""This report comes to justify the terrorists' defeat and the victories of the Syrian Arab Army and its allies,"" the source added.

It dismissed the HRW report as ""unprofessional"" and ""non-scientific"" and based on distorting facts, stressing that the report will definitely lose ground when faced with any scientific study or legal evidence.

""The Syrian Arab Republic, which has met all its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, strongly condemns this misleading report that came out in implementation of Western agendas before the convening of meetings in Astana and Geneva and any other meetings that might be held later on the Syrian file,"" the Foreign Ministry source said.

The source reiterated Syria's condemnation of the use of toxic chemical weapons by any part, in any place and for any reason, stressing that all these allegations will not discourage it from continuing its war against the terrorist organizations and their backers.

President Bashar al–Assad was speaking during a meeting with the youth religious team that includes religious figures and Islamic preachers from all Syrian provinces with the attendance of Minister of Awqaf (Religious Endowments) Mohammad Abdul-Sattar al-Sayyed.

During the meeting, President al-Assad lauded the work which the team has been able to achieve within one year of its creation, considering that this team gives a civilized image of moderation in the Islamic religion.

He affirmed that one of the most important things that the team has to attend to is reshaping terms and correcting misconceptions in order to spread the true religion in the face of extremism.

President al-Assad pointed out that the war the Syrians are currently waging is a war of mind, and hence comes the need that the team members master dialogue tools and put into use the method of analysis and inference in order to establish a balanced non-superficial discourse in raising religious issues.

He stressed the importance of methodology in work and the developing of criteria to the effect of creating a collective state of consciousness because ""we can't understand the Holy Quran, if we do not understand life, and we can't apply it unless we understand the philosophy of life.""

For their part, members of the youth religious team briefed the President on their work over the past period and their plan for 2017 that will be focused on the strategy of change in the way of thinking and regarding the pattern followed in religious discourse, relying in this regard on the method of analysis and not dictation.

They used the opportunity of the meeting to convey to President al-Assad Aleppo people's pride in his words when he said ""the liberation of Aleppo has turned time into history. Members of the team who are from Lattakia province also conveyed to the President the great relief felt over the recent liberation of kidnapped people held by terrorist organizations in 2013.

In his comments about Aleppo, President al-Assad considered that the steadfastness of the people of Aleppo has been a decisive factor in the victory over terrorism along with the sacrifices of the Syrian Arab Army, noting that Aleppo has suffered a great deal, because the plot planned against it has been a huge one.

10 Feb 2017

President Bashar al-Assad gave interview to Yahoo News in which he stressed that the US needs to be genuine regarding the fight against terrorism if its wants to really defeat terrorism in Syria, adding that this aim requires a clear political position on the part of the US towards the sovereignty and unity of Syria and cooperation with its government and people.

The following is the full text of the interview:

Question 1: Mr. President, thanks for giving us the opportunity. This is your first interview with American media since President Trump has taken office. Have you had any communications with President Trump directly or indirectly, or anybody in his administration?

President Assad: No, not yet.

Question 2: This is an opportunity for you to convey a message to President Trump, if you have one. What would you like to say to him?

President Assad: I wouldn't convey the message through the media, I would send it through a different channel, maybe diplomatic channels. But any message for us is the public one, we don't have two messages; we have one stand, one position toward what's happening in Syria, and it's about fighting terrorism.

Question 3: You said yesterday, I believe, that what you have heard from the new administration is promising. Explain what you meant.

President Assad: The position of President Trump since he started his campaign for presidency till this moment is that the priority is to fight terrorism, and we agree about this priority, that's our position in Syria, the priority is to fight terrorism, and that's what I meant by promising.

Question 4: You indicated that you thought there was some way for cooperation between the United States and Syria, but you didn't explain what that would be. What sort of cooperation can you envision?

President Assad: Against terrorists, and against terrorism. That's self-evident for us. This is beside having cooperation between any two nations, but in the meantime, in these circumstances, the priority is to have cooperation in fighting terrorism between the different nations, including Russia, Iran and Syria, of course.

Question 5: The President has tasked his Secretary of Defense with developing plans for defeating ISIS or Daesh. Among the proposals they are reportedly considering is using more special forces and even military assets such as Apache helicopters inside Syria, and arming Kurdish fighters who are fighting Daesh in the north. If such moves would defeat ISIS, would you welcome them?

Americans' only way to defeat terrorism in Syria is through cooperation with Syria's government and people

President Assad: Could the American prowess defeat the terrorists in Afghanistan or in other places? No, you cannot… it's not enough to have this Apache or F-16 or F-35, whatever you want to label it, to defeat terrorists. There has to be a more comprehensive way of dealing with that complicated issue. So, if you want to start genuinely, as United States, to do so, it must be through the Syrian government. We are here, we are the Syrians, we own this country as Syrians, nobody else, nobody would understand it like us. So, you cannot defeat the terrorism without cooperation with the people and the government of any country.

Question 6: But you have welcomed Russian troops into your country. Would you welcome American troops into your country?

President Assad: We invited the Russians, and the Russians were genuine regarding this issue. If the Americans are genuine, of course they are welcome, like any other country that wants to defeat and to fight with the terrorists. Of course, with no hesitation we can say that.

Question 7: So, you want American troops to come into Syria to help fight ISIS?

Sending troops is not enough for fighting terrorism, a genuine political position on respecting Syria's sovereignty and unity is needed

President Assad: Troops is part of the cooperation. Again, let's go back to the comprehensive, you cannot talk about sending troops if you're not genuine, if you don't have a clear political position toward not only the terrorism; toward the sovereignty of Syria, toward the unity of Syria. All these factors would lead to trust, where you can send your troops. That's what happened with the Russians; they didn't only send their troops. First of all, there's a clear political position regarding those factors. This is where the Russians could come and succeed in fighting the terrorists in Syria.

Question 8: Do you see cooperation between the United States and Russia to attack ISIS in Syria?

Any cooperation in any conflict around the world needs rapprochement between the Russians and the Americans

President Assad: It is essential. Any cooperation in any conflict around the world, it needs the, let's say, the rapprochement, between the Russians and the Americans. It's very essential, not only for Syria.

Question 9: Well, you talk to the Russians all the time, don't you?

President Assad: Of course.

Question 10: Yeah? When's the last time you spoke to President Putin.

President Assad: A few weeks ago.

Question 11: What'd you talk about?

President Assad: About the problem in Syria, about the advancement of the Syrian Army in Syria.

Question 12: Right. Are you going to try to broker some sort of arrangement between the United States and Russia in this fight?

President Assad: There's direct contact between them, and President Putin had a telephone call with President Trump a week or so, and they talked about different issues including Syria, so they don't need my role to do so, and we don't have any contact with the Americans to help the Russians make contact or improve their relation. We're not in that position.

Question 13: President Trump recently said he absolutely wants to create ""safe zones"" inside Syria to protect refugees, and possibly allow many of them to return. If such a move would help protect your country's endangered citizens, would you support that?

The idea of safe zones is not realistic….It's much more viable, practical and less costly to have stability than to create safe zones

President Assad: But actually, it won't. It won't. Safe zones for the Syrians could only happen when you have stability and security, where you don't have terrorists, where you don't have flow and support of those terrorists by the neighboring countries or by Western countries. This is where you can have a natural safe zone, which is our country. They don't need safe zones at all. It's much more viable, much more practical and less costly to have stability than to create safe zones. It's not a realistic idea at all.

Question 14: Upwards of half of your country's population has been displaced. How can you say that safe zones to protect them from bombardment would not be helpful?

President Assad: The first thing you have to ask: why were they displaced? If you don't answer that question, you cannot answer the rest. They were displaced for two reasons: first of all, the terrorist acts and the support from the outside. Second, the embargo on Syria. Many people didn't only leave Syria because of the security issues. As you see, Damascus is safe today, it's nearly normal life, not completely. But they don't find a way for life in Syria, so they have to travel abroad in order to find their living. So, if you lift the embargo, and if you stop supporting the terrorists – I'm not talking about the United States, I'm talking about everyone who supported terrorists including the United States during Obama's administration – if you stop all these acts, most of those people will go back to their country.

Question 15: There are, what, 4.8 million Syrian refugees since this crisis began. Just as way of comparison, that is more than 4 times the total number of Palestinian refugees from the events of 1947 and 48. Do you accept that this is a humanitarian disaster?

The refugee crisis was created due to Western, Turkish, Qatari and Saudi support to terrorists

President Assad: It is a humanitarian disaster created by the Western support of those terrorists, of course, and the regional support by Turkey and Qatar and Saudi Arabia. It didn't happen just like this.

Question 16: And you bear any responsibility at all for this disaster?

President Assad: As president?

Journalist: Yes.

President Assad: Regarding the policies that I undertake since the beginning of the crisis, they were supporting the dialogue between the Syrians, fighting terrorists, and supporting reconciliation, and they succeeded. So, no, regarding these policies, I think we were correct, and we are continuing on these pillars for the future of Syria regarding this crisis.

Question 17: As you know, President Trump has signed a very controversial executive order barring refugees, immigrants, from predominantly Muslim countries, but specifically all Syrian refugees, saying that their entry into the country would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The premise is that some of them are terrorists.

President Assad: Yeah.

Journalist: Do you agree with President Trump on this?

US ban of refugee entry is an American issue..my responsibility as Syria's President ti to restore stability to help Syrian refugees go back home

President Assad: This question has two aspects: the first one is American, this is an American issue and it's related to the sovereignty of the American nation. Every country has the right to put any regulations to enter their country. We can disagree or agree, but if you ask me as president, as official in the Syrian state, my responsibility is not to go and ask any president to allow the Syrians to go there and to have refuge in that country. My responsibility is to restore the stability, in order to bring them back to Syria and find refuge in their country. So, I'm not going to discuss that this is right or wrong; this is American issue.

Question 18: But the question was: are some of these refugees, in your view, aligned with terrorists?

President Assad: Oh, definitely.

Journalist: Definitely?

President Assad: Definitely. You can find it on the net; the same picture that you saw them – in some cases, of course – in some instances, those terrorists in Syria, holding the machinegun or killing people, they are peaceful refugees in Europe or in the West in general. Yeah, that's true.

Question 19: So, how many terrorists do you believe are among the 4.8 million Syrian refugees?

President Assad: No one has any number, nobody knows, because nobody knows all the terrorists to give a percentage, no one at all.

Question 20: Do you believe it's a significant number?

President Assad: It's not about significant, because you don't need a significant number to commit atrocities. 11th of September, it happened by only 15 terrorists out of maybe millions of immigrants in the United States, so it's not about the number; it's about the quality, it's about the intentions.

Question 21: So, if what you're saying is correct, then President Trump would be justified in keeping them out of the United States?

President Assad: I'm not American to justify it; only American people would say this is against the interests of the United States or with the interests. From the outside, we can discuss it as value; this is with the values of the humanitarian situation in the world or not, that's how we can discuss it. But again, I can only speak as president; for me the priority is to bring those citizens to their country, not to help them immigrate. That's the natural duty according to the constitution and to the law.

Question 22: Would you welcome all of Syria's refugees back into your country?

President Assad: Definitely, definitely.

Journalist: Definitely? Even the terrorists?

President Assad: I don't have to welcome them as president; I don't own the country, it's not my house, it's not my company, it's not my farm. This is country to every Syrian.

Question 23: But if you believe that some of them are terrorists, what would you do with them when they return to Syria?

President Assad: It doesn't matter what I believe, what matters is what the law would say about every person who committed any act against his country, taking into consideration that we gave amnesty in Syria to thousands of people who committed actions or acts against their country as part of the reconciliation.

Question 24: How do you expect them to return? What is your vision or plan for bringing Syria's refugees back into Syria?

President Assad: Already many of them, not a huge number, but many of them came back to Syria, many of them, in spite of the security issues and the embargo. So, the majority of Syrians would like to come back to their country. This is natural for every citizen. They will come back when there's security and when there's no embargo.

Question 25: Your military, just last month, drove the rebels from eastern Aleppo. Do you see this as a turning point in Syria's civil war, and do you believe you've now won this war?

Aleppo is an important step in the fight against terrorism, but the turning point was taking the decision to fight terrorism  in spite of  propaganda 

President Assad: No, it's not a turning point. The turning point was when we took the decision to fight terrorism in spite all the propaganda against us abroad, especially in the West, and against every pressure. That was the turning point. Aleppo is an important step against terrorists, in the fight against terrorism, but I cannot say it is a turning point, because we're still going in the same way, in the same direction, we haven't changed our direction. Maybe for the terrorists it's a turning point? They better answer. Maybe for their masters in the West and in the region, it could be, but they have to answer, I cannot answer on their behalf.

Question 26: I was asking you before about potential cooperation between the United States and Syria, but the problem that many would have with that is the continued allegations of human rights abuses by your government. Now, just today, we have a new report from Amnesty International about Sednaya prison, ""human slaughterhouse"" they call it, 5,000 to 13,000 detainees hanged in mass hangings there, horrific conditions, trials of blindfolded prisoners, one to three minutes in length, no lawyers, secret, all in secret. This would, on its face, be contrary to every aspect of international law. What do you know about what's going on in that prison?

President Assad: Let's first of all talk about the first part of your question, which is the problem how to – for the United States – to open relations with Syria, regarding the human rights. I will ask you: how could you have this close, very close relation, intimate relation, with Saudi Arabia? Do you consider beheading as human right criteria?

Journalist: But I'm not interviewing the King of Saudi Arabia right, I'm interviewing you.

President Assad: Yeah, I know. Yeah, of course.

Journalist: I'm asking you about reports of human rights abuses in your prison, in your country.

The US is in no position to say ""I don't open relations [with Syria] because of human rights, as it has killed millions of civilians since Vietnam war till this moment

President Assad: You own the question, I own the answers, so that's my answer. So, when you answer about Saudi Arabia and your relation, you can put yourself in that position. Second, the United States is in no position to talk about human rights; since Vietnam war till this moment, they killed millions of civilians, if you don't want to talk about 1.5 million in Iraq, without any assignment by the Security Council. So, the United States is in no position to say ""I don't open relations because of human rights,"" and they have to use one standard. This is first.

The second part now. Now I can move to the other part, that report, like many other reports published by Amnesty International, put into question the credibility of Amnesty International, and we never look at it as unbiased. It's always biased and politicized, and it's a shame for such an organization to publish a report without a shred of evidence. They said it's based on interviews, on interviews.

Journalist: Yes.

President Assad: What about the documents? What about the concrete evidence? Not a single concrete…

Journalist: Interviews with four former prison officials and guards, three former Syrian judges, three doctors…

President Assad: It means nothing.

Journalist: It means nothing?

President Assad: It's interview… no, no, when you need to make a report, you need concrete evidence. You can make any report, you can pay money to anyone like Qatar did last year. They paid money for such a report, and they brought their own witnesses, and they made a report.

Question 27: I wanna just read you something from the report… ""the process of hanging is authorized by officials at the highest levels of the government. Death sentences are approved by the Grand Mufti of Syria, and by either the Minister of Defense or the Chief of Staff of the Army, who are deputized to act on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad.""

President Assad: First of all, what's the evidence? This is first. Second…

Journalist: Is it true or not?

President Assad: No, no, it's not true, definitely not true.

Journalist: How do you know? Do you know what goes on in that prison? Have you been there?

President Assad: No, I haven't been, I've been in the Presidential Palace, not in the prison.

Journalist: So here you have a very disturbing report about something going on in one of your prisons, are you going to investigate?

President Assad: So, Amnesty International knows more about Syria than me, according to you. No, that's not true. No, they haven't been to Syria, they only base their reports on allegation, they can bring anyone, doesn't matter what's his title, you can forge anything these days, and we're living in a fake news era, as you know, everybody knows this. So, we don't have to depend on this. Second, you have to talk about the reality, they said in their report that we made serial executions, is that correct?

Journalist: Yes. Mass hangings.

President Assad: First of all, execution is part of the Syrian law. If the Syrian government or institution wants to do it, they can make it legally, because it's been there for decades.

Journalist: Secret trials, no lawyers?

President Assad: Why do they need it, if they can make it legally? They don't need anything secret.

Journalist: Is that legal, in your country?

President Assad: Yeah, yeah, of course, it's legal, for decades, since the independence. The execution, according to the law, after trial, is a legal action, like any other court in many countries in this region.

Question 28: Will you allow international monitors to visit that prison and inspect and investigate these reports?

President Assad: It depends on the credibility of that organization, not anyone, because they're going to use this visit just to demonize the Syrian government more and more and more, like what's happening.

Question 29: This is not the first time that very serious human rights allegations have been made. Just last week, a woman in Spain, Syrian, filed a lawsuit accusing nine of your senior government intelligence and security officials of human rights abuses. Her brother had disappeared in one of your prisons. You asked about documents, the lawyers who have filed this, accusing your government of human rights abuses, have collected 3,000 pages of evidence and over 50,000 photographs taken by one of your former government's photographers showing emaciated, tortured bodies in your prisons.

President Assad: Who verified the pictures? Who verified that they're not edited and photoshopped and so on?

Journalist: Have you seen the photos?

President Assad: No, I didn't.

Journalist: Have you seen the photos?

President Assad: No, no, I saw some photos in previous reports. But it's not about the photo. How can you verify the photo?

Journalist: You have said that the…

President Assad: Do you have a photo?

Journalist: I do have the photos.

President Assad: Can you show it to me?

Journalist: Yes, I'll be happy to. here.

President Assad: This photo… have you verified who are those?

Journalist: I… can tell you…

President Assad: Because you have it, and because you mention it in front of your audience…

Journalist: There's a number of photos…

President Assad: You have to convince your audiences, you cannot mention such a picture without verifying who are those and where and everything about, just to put it in front of the audience, tell them ""they've been killed by the Syrian soldiers.""

Journalist: The woman who filed the lawsuit, the Syrian woman who filed the lawsuit said she saw her brother in those photographs.

President Assad: At the end, these are allegations. We have to talk about concrete evidence, at the end. That's how you can base your judgment. Anyone can say whatever he wants.

Question 30: The US State Department gave these photos to the American FBI crime lab, digital lab. They examined these photos, and said the bodies and scenes depicted – these are 242 of these images – the bodies and scenes depicted exhibit no artifacts or inconsistencies that would indicate they have manipulated. As a result of the above observations, all of these 242 images appear to depict real people and events.

President Assad: Who said that?

Journalist: The FBI. Have you seen their report?

President Assad: No. When was that?

Journalist: That was 2015.

President Assad: The question is when your institutions were honest about what's happening in Syria? That's the question. Never. For us, never, so we don't have to rely on what they say, if the FBI say something, it's not evidence for anyone, especially for us. The most important thing: if you take these photos to any court in your country, could they convict any criminal regarding this? Could they tell you what this crime is, who committed it? If you don't have this full picture, you cannot make judgement, it's just propaganda, it's just fake news, they want to demonize the Syrian government. In every war, you can have any individual crime, it happened here, all over the world, anywhere, but it's not a policy.

Question 31: But let me just… If I hear what you're saying, the FBI is just forwarding… propagating propaganda, Amnesty International is propagating propaganda, everybody is conspiring against the Syrian government. Why?

President Assad: Ask them, we're not…

Journalist: You're the one making the allegation.

President Assad: No, no, I'm not making an allegation, they supported the terrorists, and you go back to what they said… John Kerry, a few months ago, said and by his voice that ""we were watching ISIS advancing, and we expected the Syrian president to make concessions."" What does it mean? Obama said it in one of his speeches, that the war on Iraq created ISIS. So, who supported ISIS? We didn't create it, you created it, the United States created all this mess. Who supported the rebels and called them ""moderate rebels"" while they became ISIS and al-Nusra in Syria? We didn't. So, it's not a conspiracy, these are facts, this is reality. We didn't give money, we didn't support these terrorists. Your country supported them, UK, France, publicly, and they said they sent armaments, we didn't. So, it's not my allegation, it's your official allegation, including Joe Biden, the Vice President of Obama. He said, about Saudi Arabia and other countries supporting the extremists…

Journalist: That's Saudi Arabia, but the United States…

President Assad: So, this allegation is their allegation, it's American allegation before it's been Syrian allegation.

Question 32: The United States and its coalition partners have been bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it's supporting the Iraqi army in its efforts to liberate Mosul from ISIS. How can you say that the United States is supporting ISIS?

President Assad: Can you explain to me how could they defeat ISIS in Iraq, and ISIS was expanding since the American coalition started attacking in Syria?

Journalist: Is it expanding now?

President Assad: It's been expanding, no, it's…

Journalist: Is it expanding now?

ISIS started shrinking after Russian intervention not the American intervention

President Assad: It started shrinking after the Russian intervention, not the American one. How could they use our oil fields and export with thousands of barrel trucks to Turkey without being seen by your drones and by your satellites while the Russians could be able to do so and attack them and destroy them. destroy all their facilities? How? This is cosmetic campaign against ISIS.

Question 33: Just to be clear; I have shown you the FBI report, I have shown the photographs, I have shown you the Amnesty International report. Will you cooperate in investigations to determine if these very serious reports are in fact true?
President Assad: You showed me many things, but you didn't show me a single evidence.

Journalist: I showed you an FBI report.

President Assad: No, no, it's not evidence at all. It's actually the contrary; any American institution for us during the Syrian crisis was against the reality, it was the opposite of the truth. That's how we look at it. So, it's not a Syrian institution, we don't care about what they say. For me, what I care about is what reports I have from Syrian people, and we had investigations, because we have many claims regarding not mass crimes, actually, more individual acts and we've been investigating many, and many people were punished, but that happened in every war.

Question 34: Do you… are you disturbed enough about any of this to try to determine the truth yourself?

President Assad: I think you should show it to Western officials to ask them that question: are they disturbed to see what's happening since they started supporting the terrorists in Syria? This killing and this destruction? That's the question. Of course I'm disturbed; I am Syrian.

Journalist: You are disturbed about this? About these reports?

President Assad: About what's happening in Syria. No, no, not about the report. I don't care about the report.

Journalist: Not about this.

President Assad: No, no, I'm disturbed about what's happening in Syria. It's my country, it's being destroyed by proxy terrorists, of course.

Question 35: You have acknowledged that your troops in this war have committed mistakes in its prosecution against the rebels, and that anyone could be punished. So, how many mistakes are we talking about?

President Assad: No, I didn't say that. I never said that. I said there are always mistakes in any action; that's a human…

Journalist: How many mistakes are we talking about? How many innocent civilians have been killed by your government's mistakes?

President Assad: Nobody knows, because thousands and thousands of those are missing people; nobody knows anything about their fate, nobody at all. So, you cannot tell till the end of this war.

Question 36: Was it a mistake to bomb hospitals in Aleppo?

President Assad: We never bombed hospitals in Aleppo. Why to bomb a hospital? Can you convince your audience that we have interest in bombing hospitals? Actually, this is against our interest. This is against our interest to bomb a hospital if it's used as hospital, and the proof that it was a lie, every time they talk about bombing hospitals, every time they say this is the last hospital in eastern part of Aleppo, and the second time they talk about another hospital and they say the same; ""they bombed the last hospital."" So, it's lies and lies and lies. We can spend the whole interview talking about lies, and we can talk about the truth and reality. I have to talk about the reality.

Question 37: Is it a mistake to use barrel bombs and chlorine gas?

President Assad: You have to choose which part of the narrative is correct. Once they said we are using indiscriminate bombs and they called it barrel bombs. The other day, they said we targeted hospitals and schools and convoys. We either have precise armaments or we have indiscriminate armaments. So, which one do you choose?

Question 38: Well, you do acknowledge though that innocent civilians… there have been civilian casualties in this war?

President Assad: Of course, every war is a bad war, every war is a bad war. You cannot talk about good war. Let's agree about this. Every war has causalities; every war has innocent people to pay the price. This is the bad thing about war. That's why we need to end that war, but having casualties doesn't mean not to defend our country against the terrorists and against the invasion from abroad through those proxies by foreign countries like the Western countries and the regional ones. This is self-evident.

Question 39: President Obama gave a speech in 2013 about US counter-terrorism efforts, including drone strikes, and he says while defending those strikes, nevertheless it is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties from me and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live. Are you haunted by the deaths of innocent civilians caused by your government's military actions?

President Assad: That's an important example about the armament, it's not about what bomb do you use, whether you call it barrel or any other name; it's not about that. It's about the way you use and your intentions. That's why the state of the art drones with their missiles, the American ones, killed much more civilians than terrorists. So, it's not about the drone, it's not about the armaments; it's about your intentions. In our case in Syria, of course we have to avoid the civilians, not only because they are our people and this is a moral issue; it's actually because it's going to play into the hands of the terrorists. If we kill the civilians intentionally, it means we are helping the terrorists. So, why would we do it, why we are defending the civilians and killing the civilians? It doesn't work; this is contradiction. If we are killing the civilians, who are we defending in Syria? Against who and for who?

Question 40: You were asked just yesterday: are all means justified in this war, and you said, your answer was yes, it's a duty. So, you can use every mean in order to defend the Syrian people.

President Assad: Exactly.

Journalist: Every mean?

President Assad: Every mean.

Journalist: Including torture?

President Assad: No, it's not a defense; torture is not a defense. Why to use torture? What's the relation between torture and defending your country?

Journalist: So, where you draw the line?

President Assad: You have rules, you have very clear rules like any army; when you want to defend your country, you use your armaments against the terrorists. This is the only rule that I'm talking about. This is all the means that you can use in order to defend your country militarily, if I'm talking about military. Of course, you have to defend it politically, economically, in every sense of the word. But if you talk militarily, torture is not part of defending your country.

Question 41: Last question: can you just give us your vision of a settlement of this conflict, and can it… under any circumstances, will you be willing to step aside if it can end this disaster of a war for the Syrian people?

President Assad: Definitely, for me, whenever the Syrian people don't want me to be in that position, I will leave right away, this is a very simple answer for me and I don't have to think about it, and I'm not worried about this. What I would worry about is if I'm in that position and I don't have the public support; this is going to be a big problem for me and I can't bear it, and I cannot produce anyway. Regarding the first part, how would I see the solution, two pillars: the first one is fighting terrorism; without fighting terrorism and defeating the terrorists, no other solution would be fruitful at all, at all, any kind of solution. In parallel, dialogue between the Syrians about the future of Syria, that will include anything, everything, regarding the whole political system, the whole Syria in every sense of the word, then when we can get elections, and you can have national unity government, then you can have parliamentarian elections, then if the Syrian people think about early presidential elections or any kind of presidential elections, that will be viable.

Journalist: So, earlier than the completion of your term, which I believe, is in 2021?

President Assad: If there is public consensus about this.

Question 42: How would you determine whether there's public consensus or not?

President Assad: We can discuss it at that time; it's still early to talk about it. We haven't finished any of the stages that I'm talking about. So, we never thought about how because we don't know what circumstances are we going to face that time. But at the end, when you live in a country, you can sense; Syria is not a continent, it's a small country, we can deal with each other, we can know each other as society. You can sense, you can feel if there is public consensus, and then if you want to do something documented, you can have referendum, that's very clear.

Question 43: Do you have any cause for optimism?

President Assad: Of course, without that optimism we wouldn't fight for six years. The only… the main optimism that we've had is that we're going to defeat those terrorists and their masters, and we're going to restore stability in Syria, and more important than my optimism is the determination of the Syrian people; this is very important source for optimism. Without that determination, you wouldn't see Syria in these very difficult and exceptional circumstances still living the minimum life, let's say, if not the normal life, but the minimum life, to survive, and for the government to offer different services and subsidies, and so on.

Journalist: Thank you Mr. President.

President Assad: Thank you very much.

""Media sources reported clashes between the Syrian army and the Turkish-backed Euphrates Shield Operation troops in the Eastern part of Aleppo province for the first time.
Fire fights were reported between the Syrian government forces and Turkish-backed militants Southwest of the ISIL stronghold of Al-Bab in Aleppo province.

The Syrian forces opened fire on the militants' vehicle at the Abu Zindin village as it was on the move to block the Army's advance in the region, and the militants responded with light and semi-heavy machineguns as both parties race to take over the strategic city, the AMN reported.

A monitoring group also disclosed that Syrian army soldiers and Turkish forces clashed near Syria's border with Turkey, in a first such confrontation since Turkish forces entered Syrian territory without permission from Damascus.""

Feb 10, 2017 

President Bashar Assad said that the United States will be able to defeat terrorism in Syria only in cooperation with the Syrian authorities.

""If you want to start genuinely, as the United States, to do so, it must be through the Syrian government… You cannot defeat the terrorism without cooperation with the people and the government of any country,"" Assad said in an interview with the Yahoo News portal.

The US-led coalition has not been coordinating its actions in Syria with Damascus and has repeatedly called for Assad's resignation.

Assad called US President Donald Trump's idea on establishment of safe zones in Syria absolutely unrealistic. ""It's not a realistic idea at all,"" he added.

Recently, Trump emphasized that he ""will absolutely do safe zones in Syria"" for refugees in order to halt the flow of migrants from Syria to other states.

Earlier, Pres Assad said that Trump's attempts to fight terrorism will be impeded by major US media outlets and different companies that have their own financial interest in doing so. Moreover, he said that improved Russia-US relations under the Trump administration will help resolve the Syrian crisis.

Op-Ed | 9 Feb, 2017 

""Donald Trump is proving himself a President prone to unleashing inconvenient truths side by side blatant falsehoods. One of the most scurrilous of those falsehoods is his recent claim that Iran is the ""number one terrorist state.""
Throughout his campaign for the White House in 2016, and since assuming office in January, Trump has made Iran the focus of his ire, to the point where the Iranians are more than justified in preparing for the very real prospect of military confrontation with the US - and sooner rather than later.

The Trump administration's consistent and ongoing demonization of Iran flies in the face of reality in which Iran has stood, alongside Syria, Russia, the Kurds, and the Iranian-backed Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah, as a pillar against the very same Salafi-jihadist terrorism that poses a threat to the American people. It is a struggle in which the Iranians have expended both resources and blood in recent years, and as such justice demands that the world, including the United States, acknowledges that it owes Tehran a debt of gratitude.""

President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad received on Thursday tens of women and children who were released after they had been abducted from their villages in Lattakia countryside by terrorist groups for more than three and a half years.

""We have waited for this moment for long time… for three and a half  years… everyday, the people have been asking for you, and the State, with all its institutions, have been searching for you, the target of each soldier and each martyr was your return,"" President al-Assad said during the reception.

The President added ""In spite of all suffering you have encountered, we want you to return to your normal life with your families, villages and country… we want you to be an example in steadfastness, challenge and patriotism, and you are so.""

For her part, Mrs. Asma al-Assad affirmed that the strength of will, embodied by the abducted, women with their children during the years of abduction, should continue through rebuilding their life and trying to compensate the children for what they lost of education and life.

The freed women said that in spite of the inhuman conditions and difficult days they have passed through while abducted, their confidence in the state and its institutions hasn't been shaken since the first day of their abduction, showing determination to overcome difficulties.

100681426711941_1246936475419758,"#Syria | 'My country was destroyed'
The story below is from Tima Kurdi, the aunt of the boy who drowned en route to Greece.

""I am the aunt of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian boy who tragically drowned September 2, 2015. The devastating image of my 2-year old nephew's lifeless body, lying face-down on the beach in Turkey, was all over the news across the world.

Two weeks ago, I got home from work and my husband showed me a video of Tulsi Gabbard talking about her visit to my home country of Syria. The things she was saying about the United States policy of regime change and how the West and the Gulf countries are funding the rebel groups who wind up with the terrorists are true. I was shocked because it's something no other U.S. politician has the courage to say.

Regime change policy has destroyed my country and forced my people to flee. Tulsi's message was exactly what I have been trying to say for years, but no one wants to listen.

I live in Canada now, but I was born and raised in Damascus, Syria. Growing up, our country was peaceful, beautiful and safe. Our neighbors were Christian, Muslim, Sunni, Shia; all kinds of religion and color. We all lived together and respected each other. Syria is a secular country. In 2011, the war started in Syria. Most of my family was still in Damascus. I was always in close contact with them and talked to them on the phone on a daily basis.

For a year, I heard many tragic stories of people, friends, and neighbors who I grew up with having died in this war. Ultimately, my family had to flee to Turkey. I did what everyone would do for their own family to help, I sent them money and I listened to their struggles to survive as refugees in Turkey.

In 2014, I went to Turkey to visit my family and tried to help them. What I saw and experienced is not what we all saw in the news or we heard in the radio. It was worse than I could ever have imagined. I saw people in the streets without homes, without hope. Children were hungry, begging for a piece of bread. I heard many heartbreaking stories from other refugees who were suffering so much and many who had lost loved ones in the war. After I returned to Canada, I decided I wanted to bring my family here as refugees, but I couldn't get them approved to come in. Eventually, my brother Abdullah and his wife Rehana, like thousands of Syrians, decided they had to take the risk and trust a smuggler they thought would bring them to freedom, safety, and hope.
In September 2, 2015, I heard the tragic news that my sister-in-law Rehana and her two sons drowned crossing from Turkey to Greece. The image of my two year old nephew Alan Kurdi lying face down on a Turkish beach was all over the media across the world. It was the wake up call to the world. Enough suffering. Enough killing. And most importantly, it was my wake up call.

Since that time, I decided to speak up on behalf of all the Syrian refugees and be their voice, to call upon other countries to open their hearts and doors to my people, and also, to end the regime change war that's causing more people to flee. I do not support one side or the other in the Syrian conflict. But I'm very frustrated by the Western media's one-sided coverage of this war. The U.S., the West, and the Gulf countries are funding rebels associated with al-Qaeda and ISIS, giving them weapons to empower them to keep fighting and destroy and divide Syria. I know first-hand. I've been trying to tell the world about what is happening in Syria, but the media doesn't want people to hear the truth.

That's why I got in touch with Tulsi to tell her that I support her message to stop arming terrorists, to stop supporting regime change. Like me, many Syrians are encouraged that Tulsi met with President Bashar Assad in Syria. Tulsi recognizes that we need to talk to him because a political solution is the only way to restore peace in Syria.

If the West keeps funding the rebels, we will see more people flee, more bloodshed, and more suffering. My people have suffered for at least six years.This is not about supporting Bashar. This is about ending the war in Syria.

We can't continue like this, supporting regime change. We have seen it before in Iraq, in Libya, and look what happened to them. They feel there is no end at sight.

My country is being destroyed, my people are displaced and nobody wants them. Regime change war is going to kill more people and cause more people to flee. That's all I can say.
Thank you Tulsi, and thank you everyone for your action and for reading my message. Please help support those who have been forced to flee their homes and please understand what this regime change policy is doing to the people in my country.

Thank you,
Tima Kurdi""

8 Feb 2017

The President's remarks came on Wednesday during a meeting  with a delegation of the Russian State Duma, headed by member of Russian Federation Council Dmitry Sablin, who is the coordinator of relations between the Duma and the People's Assembly.

The President affirmed that the Syrian people are determined to defending their country and going ahead with the national reconciliation process as it is the most effective way to move towards ending the war and achieving peaceful solution.

He hailed Russia's position and the sacrifices it has made in the course of the war against the terrorist organizations in Syria, highlighting the importance of the role Russia plays in Syria and In the international arena in the face of the Western projects that are aimed at imposing hegemony on the countries that adhere to their independence and sovereignty and the interests of their people.

The talks discussed the latest developments in Syria and the bilateral relations between the two friendly countries and the importance of boosting them, especially with regard to the war against terrorism and the reconstruction process in Syria.

Members of the Russian delegation stressed that the people of Russia stand by the Syrian people in their war against terrorism and support President Vladimir Putin's decisions in this regard as they believe that the result of this war will affect not only the future of Syria but also Russia and the entire world.

They also stressed that Russia is keen on providing humanitarian support to the Syrian people to alleviate their suffering caused by the terrorist war they are subjected to.

The Russian figures affirmed the need for concerted efforts to put an end to this suffering and restore peace and stability to Syria as soon as possible.

In a statement to SANA, head of the Russian delegation said the meeting with President al-Assad was ""very good"" where issues of communication on the political and economic levels were discussed.

Issues of cooperation in providing assistance to the Syrian people in the fields of education and health through exchange of expertise were also tackled during the meeting, according to Sablin.

Sablin said the security situation in Syria is good and reassuring and that there is a feeling that terrorism will be eliminated.

On Monday, President al-Assad received a Belgian parliamentary delegation and exchanged with them viewpoints on the latest developments in Syria and the latest international changes

The Belgian delegation stressed in the meeting that the Syrian Arab Army's success in liberating Aleppo has contributed to a large extent in shifting the balance of power in the war against terrorism and in changing the attitude of so many officials in Western countries.

7 Feb 2017

President Bashar al-Assad stressed that Syria is owned by the Syrians and that the peace is two things: fighting terrorists and terrorism, stopping the flowing of terrorism, every kind of logistical support. Second, dialogue between the Syrians to decide the future of their country and the whole political system.

On his expectations from the new administration in Washington,  President Assad said, in a statement to Belgian media,What we heard as statements by Trump during the campaign and after the campaign is promising regarding the priority of fighting terrorists, and mainly ISIS, that's what we've been asking for during the last six years. So, I think this is promising, we have to wait, it's still early to expect anything practical. It could be about the cooperation between the US and Russia, that we think is going to be positive for the rest of the world, including Syria. So, as I said, it's still early to judge it.

Question 1: Mr. President, we've been to Aleppo, we've seen the destruction, how do you see the way forward to peace nowadays after Astana?

President Assad: If you want to talk about how to see the peace, it's not related mainly to Astana; it's related to something much bigger: how can we stop the flowing of the terrorists toward Syria, or in Syria, how can we stop the support from regional countries like Turkey, Gulf states, or from Europe like France and UK, or from the US during the Obama administration. If we deal with that title, this is where you can talk about the rest, about the political procedure. Astana is one of the initiatives during this war on Syria, and it's about the dialogue between the Syrians. Now it's too early to judge Astana, the first one was positive because it was about the principles of the unity of Syria, about the Syrians deciding their future. How can you implement this communique? That's the question, and I think we are going to see Astana 2 and so on. So, the peace is two things: fighting terrorists and terrorism, stopping the flowing of terrorism, every kind of logistical support. Second, dialogue between the Syrians to decide the future of their country and the whole political system. These are the headlines about how we see the future of Syria.

Question 2: We have seen many breaches in the ceasefire, would you consider the ceasefire is still upholding, or is it dead?

President Assad: No, it's not dead, and it's natural in every ceasefire anywhere in the world, in every war, in any conflict, to have these breaches. It could be sometimes on individual levels, it doesn't mean there's policy of breaching the ceasefire by the government or by any other party, and this is something we can deal with on daily basis, and sometimes on hourly basis, but till this moment, no, the ceasefire is holding.

Question 3: In the fight against terror group Daesh, do you think all means are justified?

President Assad: Depends on what do we mean by ""all means,"" you have to be…

Journalist: Literally all means.

President Assad: Yeah, but I don't know what the means that are available to tell you yes or ""all means,"" so I don't what the ""all means"" are. But if you want to talk about military means, yes of course, because the terrorists are attacking the people – I'm not only talking about ISIS; ISIS and al-Nusra and all the Al Qaeda-affiliated groups within Syria – when they are attacking civilians, and killing civilians, and beheading people, and destroying properties, private and public, and destroying the infrastructure, everything in this country, let's say, our constitutional duty and legal duty as government and as army and as state institutions is to defend the Syrian people. It's not an opinion; it's a duty. So, regarding this, you can use every mean in order to defend the Syrian people.

Question 4: But we have seen the destruction in Aleppo, you have seen the images as well. Was there no other way to do it?

President Assad: Actually, since the beginning of the crisis, of the war on Syria, we used every possible way. We didn't leave any stone unturned in order to bring people to the negotiating table, but when you talk about the terrorists, when you talk about terrorists, when you talk about Al Qaeda, when you talk about al-Nusra and ISIS, I don't think anyone in this world would believe that they are ready for dialogue, and they always say they're not; they have their own ideology, they have their own way path, they don't accept anything that could be related to civil state or civil country, they don't, and I think you know as a European about this reality. So, no, making dialogue with al-Nusra and Al Qaeda is not one of the means, but if somebody wanted to change his course on the individual levels, we are ready to accept him as a government, and give him amnesty when he goes back to the normal life and gives up his armament.

Question 5: The Belgian government is contributing in the fight against Daesh. There are six F-16 fighter planes in the fight against Daesh. Are you grateful to the Belgian government for that contribution?

President Assad: Let me be frank with you, when you talk about contribution in the operation against ISIS, actually there was no operation against ISIS; it was a cosmetic operation, if you want to talk about the American alliance against ISIS. It was only an illusive alliance, because ISIS was expanding during that operation. At the same time, that operation is an illegal operation because it happened without consulting with or taking the permission of the Syrian government, which is the legitimate government, and it's a breaching of our sovereignty. Third, they didn't prevent any Syrian citizen from being killed by ISIS, so what tobe grateful for? To be frank, no.

Question 6: You have stated several times that it is up to the Syrian people, it is up to the constitution, to decide who their leadership should be, who their president should be. If the Syrian people would decide for a new leadership, would you consider to step aside?

President Assad: If the Syrian people choose another president, I don't have to choose to be aside; I would be aside, I would be outside this position, that's self-evident, because the constitution will put the president, and the constitution will take him out according to the ballot box and the decision of the Syrian people. Of course, that's very natural, not only because of the ballot box; because if you don't have public support, you cannot achieve anything in Syria, especially in a war. In a war, what you need, the most important thing is to have public support in order to restore your country, to restore the stability and security. Without it, you cannot achieve anything. So, yes, of course.

Question 7: Mr. President, I am 43 years old, if I would have been born in Syria, there would always have been an Assad in executive power. Can you imagine a Syria without a member of the Assad family in executive power?

President Assad: Of course, we don't own the country, my family doesn't own the country, to say that only Assad should be in that position, that's self-evident, and this could be by coincidence, because President Assad didn't have an heir in the institution to be his successor. He died, I was elected, he didn't have anything to do with my election. When he was president, I didn't have any position in the government. If he wanted me to be an heir, he would have put me somewhere, gave me a responsibility, I didn't have any responsibility, actually. So, it's not as many in the media in the West used to say since my election, that ""he succeeded his father"" or ""his father put him in that position."" So, yes, Syria is owned by the Syrians, and every Syrian citizen has the right to be in that position.

Question 8: Do you think the European Union or even NATO can play a role in, like, rebuilding the country, like, rebuilding Syria?

President Assad: You cannot play that role while you are destroying Syria, because the EU is supporting the terrorists in Syria from the very beginning under different titles: humanitarians, moderate, and so on. Actually, they were supporting al-Nusra and ISIS from the very beginning, they were extremists from the very beginning. So, they cannot destroy and build at the same time. First of all, they have to take a very clear position regarding the sovereignty of Syria, stop supporting the terrorists. This is where the Syrians would – I say would – accept those countries to play a role in that regard. But in the meantime, if you ask any Syrian the same question, he will tell you ""no, we don't accept, those countries supported the people who destroyed our country, we don't want them to be here."" That's what I think.

Question 9: Do you think Belgium can play a role in Syria?

President Assad: Let me talk about the European political position in general; many in this region believe that the Europeans don't exist politically, they only follow the master which is the Americans. So, the question should be about the Americans, and the Europeans will follow and will implement what the Americans want. They don't exist as independent states, and Belgium is part of the EU.

Question 10: There is a new administration in Washington, with Trump in power. What do you expect from it? Are you looking to work closely together?

President Assad: What we heard as statements by Trump during the campaign and after the campaign is promising regarding the priority of fighting terrorists, and mainly ISIS, that's what we've been asking for during the last six years. So, I think this is promising, we have to wait, it's still early to expect anything practical. It could be about the cooperation between the US and Russia, that we think is going to be positive for the rest of the world, including Syria. So, as I said, it's still early to judge it.

Question 11: If you look back on the last couple of years, are there any things that you regret?

President Assad: Every mistake could be a regret, by any individual, and as a human…

Journalist: Have you made mistakes?

President Assad: As a human, I have to make mistakes to be human. Otherwise, I'm not a human.

Journalist: What would you consider a mistake?

President Assad: A mistake is when you either take a wrong decision or make a wrong practice, it depends on the situation. But if you want to talk about the crisis, as I understand from the question, the three decisions that we took from the very beginning is to fight terrorism, and I think it's correct, is to make dialogue between the Syrians, I think it's correct, to respond to every political initiative, whether it's genuine or not, and I think it's correct, and actually we supported the reconciliation between the Syrians, and I think it's correct. Anything else could be trivial, so you have a lot of things regarding the practice, regarding the institutions, you always have mistakes.

Question 12: If you look back, was this war avoidable?

President Assad: No, because there was bad intention regarding the different countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, France, UK, and the US in order to destabilize Syria, so it wasn't about the Syrians. That doesn't mean that we don't have many flaws before the war and today as a country that allow many of those countries to mess with our country. I'm not excluding, I'm not saying it's only about them, but they were the one who took the initiative in order to wage this war, so I don't think it was avoidable.

Question 13: You have just had a visit from a Belgian parliamentary delegation with Mr. Dewinter and Mr. Carcaci, do you consider them as friends?

President Assad: The most important thing about those visits is not to be friends with them. As a politician, you don't come to Syria to visit your friend; you come to Syria to see what's going on.

Journalist: Do you see them as political allies?

President Assad: No, they're not my allies at all. They are coming here not for that reason; they are here in order to see what's going on. They are the allies of the Belgian people. They came here because the government, the Belgian government, like many European governments, are blind today, they have no relation with this country on every level, so they don't see what's going on, they cannot play any role. So, now the only eyes that you have are the delegations that are coming from your country, and this is one of them, this is one of the eyes that your government could have, and you could have many other eyes and delegations coming to Syria. So, they're not my allies, they're not coming here for me; they're coming here to see the situation, and I'm one of the players in the Syrian conflict, it's natural to meet with me to hear what's my point of view.

Question 14: Mr. President, just one more question: after the victories in Aleppo, Wadi Barada, your troops are close from al-Bab, do you think that all these major victories can change the mind of European governments concerning the Syrian government?

President Assad: I don't know, I think they have to answer that question. For us, it's our war, we need to liberate every single inch on the Syrian territory from those terrorists. If the European governments think that their efforts went in vain, that's good, they may change their mind, and at least to stop supporting those terrorists that don't have the support of the public in Syria; they only have the support of the Europeans and the Gulf states, the Wahabi Gulf states, in order to have more terrorism and extremism in Syria. We hope, I think during the last two years, the whole world has changed, the United States has changed, the situation in Syria has changed, the situation in the region in general has changed. Two things didn't change or hasn't changed till this moment: first of all, Al Qaeda is still there through ISIS and al-Nusra, and the mentality of the European officials, it hasn't change yet, they live in the past.

Question 15: Mr. President, in your opinion, what is our ______ to question if after the war, the international court in the Hague should go over some responsibles on the crimes against humanity against the Syrian people, do you support that view, that the responsibles of the crimes at war should be judged by the international court in the Hague?

President Assad: We all know that the United Nations institutions are not unbiased, they are biased, because of the American influence and the French and British, mainly. So, most of those institutions, they don't work to bring the stability to the world or to look for the truth; they are only politicized to implement the agenda of those countries. For me, as president, when I do my duty, the same for the government and for the army, to defend our country, we don't look to this issue, we don't care about it. We have to defend our country by every mean, and when we have to defend it by every mean, we don't care about this court, or any other international institution.

Question 16: Yes. Do you accept the position of the United Nations?

President Assad: It depends on that position. Most of the positions are biased, as I said, regarding every organization, regarding every sector, regarding most of the resolutions against Syria. That's why it was for the first time maybe for Russia and China to take so many vetoes in few years, because they know this reality. So, no, we don't accept, we don't accept.

5 Feb 2017

The head of the Belgian delegation currently visiting Syria, member of Belgium's Federal Parliament Filip Dewinter, said that the delegation's members will pressure the Belgian Parliament and the international organizations in which they work to lift the economic embargo imposed on Syria, noting that they witnessed during their visits to hospitals and housing centers that the embargo is affecting the Syrian people directly.

In a press conference held on Sunday evening at the new press office at the People's Assembly, Dewinter stressed the need to unite efforts to fight terrorism in Syria, adding that the Wahabi terrorists who are backed by Arab #Gulf_states and #Turkey want to destroy Syria and its #secular values.

He said that more time is needed to change the viewpoints of European governments regarding the situation in Syria, noting that it takes political courage for European politicians to visit Syria and witness the reality of what is happening in it.

Dewinter affirmed that many states practiced erroneous policies towards Syria, primarily Turkey which facilitated the movement of terrorists through its borders and funded and armed them, adding that Turkish President Recep Tayyip #Erdogan is a true #dictator whose actions will prevent Turkey from becoming a member in the EU.

He voiced dissatisfaction with the Belgian government because it doesn't view the positions of the Syrian government objectively and doesn't realize that the threat of the Wahabi terrorism in Syria will spread to Europe; rather it does as the US administration tells it.

Regarding the Belgian terrorists fighting in Syria, Dewinter said that they should either be tried if they ever return or they should be stripped of their Belgian nationality and have the Syrian people try them for their crimes.

He also pointed out to the terrorist attacks that affected several European capitals including #Paris and #Brussels, with some of the perpetrators being Belgian, affirming that Europe must become aware of the threat posed by those terrorists.

Dewinter: Western economic #sanctions on Syria are an act of dictatorship and violence against Syrian people

Earlier today, Dewinter said the Western economic sanctions on Syria are an act of ""dictatorship"" and harsh violence against the Syrian people because they have affected the humanitarian and livelihood aspects of their lives denying them access to medicines and food, describing these sanctions by ""stupid.""

During a visit to a makeshift housing center in al-Harjalleh in Damascus Countryside, Dewinter described the Western sanctions imposed on Syria as ""stupid"", saying that he will work in cooperation with the European parliamentarians to helps efforts to have the sanctions lifted to enable hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to return to their country and contribute to reconstruction there.

He hailed the reconciliation agreements achieved by the Syrian state, saying that these reconciliations are a proof of wisdom and power.

Local and media sources said that warplanes affiliated to the US-led coalition on Friday morning launched a raid on the new and old Raqqa bridges in Raqqa city, destroying them totally.

The sources added that the airstrikes also targeted the main water line which supplies the city of Raqqa with drinking water which led to cutting off drinking water to the whole city.

In the northern countryside of the province, the sources said that the airstrikes also destroyed the bridges of al-Kalta and al-Abbara completely.

2 Feb 2017

Foreign and Expatriates Ministry voiced on Thursday strong condemnation of Turkey's repeated crimes and attacks against the Syrian people and violations of the sanctity and unity of Syria's territory.

The condemnation was expressed in two letters addressed to the UN Secretary General and President of the Security Council.

The letters referred to the Turkish troops' incursion into the Syrian territories over the past few days and their occupation of some Syrian villages, including the villages of al-Ghouz and Abu Zibdin west of al-Bab city in northern Aleppo with the aim of advancing towards it.

The letters made it clear that these attacks pose a threat to the international peace and security in the framework of the exposed role played by the Turkish regime in supporting terrorism.

These attacks, the letters added, came in continuation of the Turkish regime's aggression on Syria for more than five years now, which includes providing various forms of military, material and logistic support to the terrorist organizations, in addition to facilitating the entry of foreign militants into Syria, setting up training camps for them on Turkish soil under direct Turkish intelligence supervision and providing arms and fire cover to the terrorist groups fighting inside Syria.

The Ministry expressed in its letters the Syrian government's renewed demand that the Security Council assume its responsibilities in preserving international peace and security and putting an end to the violations which the Turkish regime is committing against the Syrian people.

2 February، 2017

The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces said Thursday that the army has established control over 32 towns and farms during the military operation it carried out against ISIS terrorist organization in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province.

The General Command said in a statement SANA got a copy of that ""the army units in cooperation with the supporting forces and the allies liberated, in the large-scale military operation it has launched for 20 days against ISIS terrorist organization, more than 32 towns and farms with a total area of 250 square kilo meters with a 25-km front and a depth of 16 km, establishing control over Aleppo-al-Bab highway with a length of 16 km.""

The General Command added that the army units stormed into complicated fortifications, demined hundreds of explosives and destroyed tens of tunnels of ISIS, inflicting heavy losses upon it in weaponry and personnel.

It pointed out that this achievement expands the range of security surrounding the city of Aleppo and constitutes a platform for improving the military operations against ISIS and increasing the areas controlled by the Syrian Arab Army including the roads connecting the northern and eastern areas.

The General Command concluded by reaffirming the Army's continuation of fulfilling its nationalistic tasks in combating terrorism and commitment to its constitutional duties in protecting civilians and preserving the territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic.

1 Feb 2017

""The liberation of the water source from the terrorists was a welcome event for millions of people in Damascus. A soldier from the Syrian Army Firas Hariri told Sputnik about how liberation of the water complex Ain el Fijeh took place.

""The battle took place at night. The snipers were shooting at us from every side possible,"" Hariri said.

""From January 1 to 23 about 50 soldiers, including myself, took a position in the house opposite the source. The distance between us and the source did not exceed 100 meters. The militants using megaphones, constantly threatened us, saying that they will destroy the entire station,"" the soldier said.

According to him the Syrian soldiers started the operation from the mountains. They used an infrared camera to determine the militants' positions.

""We went for the terrorists from both the sides: by rail and along the buildings. We managed to divert their attention and destroy their united front,"" Hariri said.

The terrorists tried to mine the water source to blow it up completely but the soldiers firmly occupied the station and courageously guarded it.

After winning the battle, the soldiers found a lot of weapons such as sniper rifles and bombs, made in Israel in the terrorists' weapon arsenals.

--
Syrian Minister of Water Resources Nabil al Hasan told Sputnik:

""After a full examination of the source we came to a conclusion that 85% of the buildings above the source such as the water pumping station, equipment and power grids are all damaged. The terrorists blew it up in three different places so the source Harush is completely destroyed now,"" Hasan said.

The minister further said that the water was allowed to flow through the river channel until the water supply resumed its work.

Later on, about 10 hours after the initiation of the repair, the pumps started pumping water into the water storage of Damascus.

The water samples were then taken for quality analysis. After the results come back, it will be decided whether to supply the water to the residents.
--

In December 2016, militants from Jabhat Fatah Al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, blew up a water pipeline in the Wadi Barada area and seized the only source of drinking water for Damascus citizens.

In January 2017, the Syrian army fully liberated the Wadi Barada area near the Syrian capital of Damascus, where the main water source is located, from militants.

100681426711941_1238196262960446,"Western MSM complicit in fueling 'artificially' ignited #Syria|n war – Bolivian filmmaker Carla Ortiz, to RT

1 Feb 2017

The Syrian war was an artificial, deliberately planned and meticulously staged conflict from the very beginning, Carla Ortiz, a Bolivian documentary filmmaker told RT. She believes western MSM played a decisive role:repeating a stereotypical narrative while twisting the reality.

Ortiz, the director of the ""The Voice of Syria"" documentary, recently returned from the war-torn country, where she visited regions which suffered most from the conflict. She talked to the Syrian people struggling to save their country while rebuilding their shattered lives.

The real situation in Syria she witnessed is very different from the common narrative peddled by the western MSM. The entire idea of the Middle East being a ""territory of a constant conflict"" plagued by ""dictators,"" and Westerners being the ""saviors"" of the local people, is so customary you ""almost stop questioning what you hear,"" Ortiz told RT Spanish.

""Only when I've started to get into it, I realized that the reality, which exists on the other side, is completely different. It drastically contradicts what I supposedly 'knew' about it,"" Ortiz said.

The Syrian conflict is portrayed by the western MSM as something ""natural"" and ""organic"" but she left with the feeling that it's an artificially created campaign orchestrated from the outside.

""The war was deliberately and meticulously staged,"" Ortiz told RT. Locals told the filmmaker, that not only was the initial unrest organized and fuelled by foreigners, who infiltrated the country, but even now, the majority of militants fighting against the Syrian army are of foreign origins.

""After having traveled three fourths of the country, I realized that my dialogue with Syria's people always repeats itself. Regardless of a place, social rank and even religion, I got the same answer everywhere – this war was created artificially,"" Ortiz added.

The religious component of the conflict also proved to be greatly exaggerated, as Syrian people of different religious denominations have lived in harmony for ages.

""I made a mistake once, I asked one man – 'Are you a Muslim?' And he told me – 'I'm Syrian, we don't ask about religion in Syria,"" Ortiz said.

The Syrian people distrust western media and the West as a whole, and holds them largely responsible for the destruction of their country. The West made ousting the Syrian president a priority, instead of fighting terrorism.

Western media consume information from dubious sources and present it as ""reporting."" Even those few journalists, who were in Syria while Ortiz was filming her documentary, preferred to ""report"" from the safety of their hotel rooms.

""I can confirm, that at the critical moment of the Aleppo battle, I travelled all six fronts and there were nobody from international media,"" Ortiz said.

Ortiz witnessed and filmed the Aleppo liberation, and can state with authority that many videos, which emerged during these hard times depicting ""Assad atrocities"" or ""Russian atrocities"" were fake. Such videos have little to no gunfire, bombing and shelling sounds, while the fighting in the days before Aleppo's liberation was really intense.

""In all my videos you can hear gunfire. I don't know where such footage was filmed, if it doesn't have such sounds, especially if it was allegedly filmed in East Aleppo,"" Ortiz said.

Various shady groups, portrayed by the western media as brave warriors and ""heroes,"" such as the infamous #WhiteHelmets, are perceived quite differently by the Syrians. Rather, they are viewed as militants and terrorists who have and continue to rip their nation apart.

Syrian soldiers, young men and women, majority of whom are volunteers, struggle daily to save their country from terrorists, who grew strong on the ""free advertising"" provided by western MSM.

It's the Syrian army, which fights for its country, not some ""Assad army"" or ""regime forces"" as the MSM portrays them, Ortiz said.

ISIS began tonight's assault by pounding the airbase with missiles; this followed by a powerful ground attack on the Syrian Arab Army's defenses.

Jan 28, 2017

Media sources disclosed that the Russian Armed Forces will likely send back a number of soldiers and military hardware to Humeimim base in Lattakia province to reinvigorate their forces' combat capabilities again.

The Russian language Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily said Russia seems to redeploy its forces and equipment to the Humeimim base after the Astana peace talks.

The daily opined that liberation of Aleppo had not been a turning point in war on ISIL terrorists in Syria and Moscow made a hurried decision when started to withdraw a part of its forces and equipment from Syria.    

Russian media disclosed on Friday that Ka-52 advanced combat helicopters and Su-25 attack aircraft would join the Russian Air Group involved in the liberation of the Syrian city of Palmyra from the ISIL terrorists.

The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported that Ka-52 Alligator advanced combat helicopters and Su-25 Rook attack aircraft joined in efforts to liberate the Syrian city of Palmyra from ISIL terrorists.

The goal was to significantly strengthen the fire impact on terrorist positions, the newspaper said, referring to an interaction between a Ka-52 and a Su-35 as a combination of intelligence capabilities and high strike power.

""It is designed to compensate for the lack of Syrian artillery strike capabilities, as well as to provide effective support to government forces advancing on Palmyra,"" Izvestia said.

Vladimir Popov, the deputy chief of the Russian magazine Aviapanorama, told Sputnik that interaction between the Ka-52 and the Su-25 is one of the tactics that could be used to improve the efficiency of helicopter and aircraft strike systems.

""Using its state-of-the-art sighting and navigation equipment, the Ka-52s will transmit more accurate information about the (enemy) targets due to be bombed by the Su-25s,"" Popov said.

According to him, the super precise fire impact on ISIL's positions in Palmyra would play an important role in saving the rest of the historic monuments in this ancient city.

""It is impossible to use carpet bombing in such historically important locations, which must be preserved rather than destroyed at any cost. At the same time, it  necessary to liberate the city as quickly as possible, so it is very important to work with surgical precision when conducting pin-point strikes,"" Popov said, stressing the importance of permanently adjusting the fire.

The Presidency of the Syrian Arab Republic refuted all rumors and news about the health of President Bashar al-Assad, affirming that they are absolutely incorrect and that President al-Assad is in excellent health and carrying out his work normally.

The Presidency said that the Syrian people have become immunized against such lies that have been plentiful since the beginning of the war on Syria, asserting that such lies are no more than dreams and attempts to raise flagging morale, and that they only illicit ridicule and mockery.

The Presidency said that the source of these rumors are sides and newspapers of known affiliation and funding, noting that these rumors coincide with changes on the ground and in politics that run contrary to what certain sides have been planning for Syria during the past years.

 A crowd of people gathered outside the People's Assembly on Thursday denouncing the continued cutoff of water supply to Damascus by the terrorist organizations.

The water cutoff in Wadi Barada area, which has been going on for more than a month, has caused suffering to over five millions of the residents of Damascus, depriving them of drinking water.

A number of MPs and officials and workers from the Ministry of Water Resources and the General Establishment of Drinking Water and Sewerage of Damascus and its Countryside took part in the sit-in, which is aimed at exerting pressure on the international community and the countries funding and supporting terrorism to stop this crime committed by the terrorist groups and force them into supplying water back to Damascus residents.

""Cutting off water supply to Damascus and its suburbs is a war crime,"" a number of the participants in the sit-in said in their statements to SANA reporter.

They carried banners with slogans condemning the international community's silence on such a horrible crime and pleading that the children and all people of Syria have the right to enjoy drinking water.

Member of the People's Assembly Nidal Hmeidi dismissed cutting off water supply to a whole capital and a population of more than five millions as an ""international organized terrorism.""

Deputy Minister of Water Resources described the water cutoff as a ""cowardly act of terror"" that has been unprecedented in history, calling on the countries supporting terrorism to realize the gravity of this crime.

Assistant Director of the General Establishment of Drinking Water and Sewerage of Damascus and Its Countryside Eng. Issam al-Tabbaa said the Establishment's cadres and teams have been working around the clock for more than a month now to supply Damascus city with water from alternative sources.

The participants in the sit-in handed a letter of protest to Speaker of the People's Assembly Hadiyeh Abbas demanding that the Assembly could help in delivering it to international parliaments and the international community to let their voice heard so that the water cutoff crime could be stopped.

Abbas stressed that the People's Assembly demands that all world parliaments, human rights organizations and the UN work to pressure the countries and governments supporting the terrorists so that they stop emboldening them and encouraging them to commit more appalling crimes.

A similar letter was also handed to the UN Resident Representative in Syria, with the protesters warning that if the cutoff of the water supply continues, a ""real human catastrophe"" might emerge.

Head of the Russian delegation Alexander Lavrentyev underlined that Russia was not interfering in consideration of constitution and presented the draft to the opposition simply in order to accelerate the process.

Russian constitutional proposals for Syria that were handed over to the opposition during Astana talks suggest that the word ""Arab"" be removed from the official name of the country, the document obtained by Sputnik, reads.

""The Syrian Republic is an independent democratic sovereign state based on the principles of people and supremacy of law and equality and social unity and respect of the rights and the liberties of all citizens without any differentiation. The names of the Syrian Republic and Syria are equal,"" Russian-proposed constitutional draft, obtained by Sputnik, reads.

The document envisages changing Syria's borders only if the country's nationals support the move via a referendum.

""Any loss of Syrian territories is not acceptable, change of state borders can only be allowed through a general referendum with the participation of all citizens and on the basis of the desire of the Syrian people.""

Russian proposals for Syria suggest that the Kurdish autonomies can use Kurdish and Arabic languages on equal rights.

""The Arabic language is the official language and the way in which the official language is used will be specified by the law."" ""The Kurdish cultural self-ruling systems and its organizations use both the Arabic and Kurdish languages equally,"" the document reads.

The documents suggest that the cultural diversity of the Syrian society must be ensured. ""Upon the national heritage which promotes national unity, the cultural diversity of the Syrian society will be ensured.""

Moreover, the draft constitution proposed by Russia suggests extension of the Syrian parliament's powers so that it could declare war, impeach the president and approve the head of the Central Bank.

""The People's Assembly will be responsible for … decisions on war and peace issues, the removal of the president from the office, appointment of the members of the Supreme Constitutional Court, appointment of the head of the Syrian National Bank and his dismissal from office.""

The document also suggests the Syrian army not to be allowed to interfere in politics or used as a means of oppression.

""The [Syrian] armed forces and other armed units are under the society's supervision and they will protect Syria and its territorial integrity. They should not be used as a means of oppression of Syrian people and interfere in the sphere of political interests. They do not play a role in the process of transition of power.""

The constitutional proposals for Syria suggest that international law should be a priority in case domestic law contradicts it. The document stipulates the supremacy of the international law.

""The recognized principles and provisions of the international law and Syria's international treaties are an integral part of its legal system. If an international treaty defines different rules than that of the Syrian law, then the rules of the international treaty will be used.""

100681426711941_1230229743757098,"#Syria #mustread Letter from Dem. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard

""The Syrian People Desperately Want Peace

As much of Washington prepared for the inauguration of President Donald Trump, I spent last week on a fact-finding mission in Syria and Lebanon to see and hear directly from the Syrian people. Their lives have been consumed by a horrific war that has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and forced millions to flee their homeland in search of peace.
It is clear now more than ever: this regime change war does not serve America's interest, and it certainly isn't in the interest of the Syrian people.

We met these children at a shelter in Aleppo, whose families fled the eastern part of the city. The only thing these kids want, the only thing everyone I came across wants, is peace. Many of these children have only known war. Their families want nothing more than to go home, and get back to the way things were before the war to overthrow the government started. This is all they want.

I traveled throughout Damascus and Aleppo, listening to Syrians from different parts of the country. I met with displaced families from the eastern part of Aleppo, Raqqah, Zabadani, Latakia, and the outskirts of Damascus. I met Syrian opposition leaders who led protests in 2011, widows and children of men fighting for the government and widows of those fighting against the government. I met Lebanon's newly-elected President Aoun and Prime Minister Hariri, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard, Syrian President Assad, Grand Mufti Hassoun, Archbishop Denys Antoine Chahda of Syrian Catholic Church of Aleppo, Muslim and Christian religious leaders, humanitarian workers, academics, college students, small business owners, and more.

Their message to the American people was powerful and consistent: There is no difference between ""moderate"" rebels and al-Qaeda (al-Nusra) or ISIS — they are all the same. This is a war between terrorists under the command of groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda and the Syrian government. They cry out for the U.S. and other countries to stop supporting those who are destroying Syria and her people.

I heard this message over and over again from those who have suffered and survived unspeakable horrors. They asked that I share their voice with the world; frustrated voices which have not been heard due to the false, one-sided biased reports pushing a narrative that supports this regime change war at the expense of Syrian lives.

I heard testimony about how peaceful protests against the government that began in 2011 were quickly overtaken by Wahhabi jihadist groups like al-Qaeda (al-Nusra) who were funded and supported by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, the United States, and others. They exploited the peaceful protesters, occupied their communities, and killed and tortured Syrians who would not cooperate with them in their fight to overthrow the government.

I met a Muslim girl from Zabadani who was kidnapped, beaten repeatedly, and raped in 2012, when she was just 14 years old, by ""rebel groups"" who were angry that her father, a sheep herder, would not give them his money. She watched in horror as masked men murdered her father in their living room, emptying their entire magazine of bullets into him.

I met a boy who was kidnapped while walking down the street to buy bread for his family. He was tortured, waterboarded, electrocuted, placed on a cross and whipped, all because he refused to help the ""rebels"" — he told them he just wanted to go to school. This is how the ""rebels"" are treating the Syrian people who do not cooperate with them, or whose religion is not acceptable to them.

Although opposed to the Assad government, the political opposition spoke strongly about their adamant rejection of the use of violence to bring about reforms. They argue that if the Wahhabi jihadists, fueled by foreign governments, are successful in overthrowing the Syrian state, it would destroy Syria and its long history of a secular, pluralist society where people of all religions have lived peacefully side by side. Although this political opposition continues to seek reforms, they are adamant that as long as foreign governments wage a proxy regime change war against Syria using jihadist terrorist groups, they will stand with the Syrian state as they work peacefully toward a stronger Syria for all Syrians.

Originally, I had no intention of meeting with #Assad, but when given the opportunity, I felt it was important to take it. I think we should be ready to meet with anyone if there's a chance it can help bring about an end to this war, which is causing the Syrian people so much suffering.

I met these amazing women from Barzi, many of whom have husbands or family members who are fighting with al-Nusra/al-Qaeda, or with the Syrian army. When they come to this community center, all of that is left behind, as they spend time with new friends, learning different skills like sewing, making plans for their future. They were strangers before coming to this community center whose mission is empowering these women, and now they are "" sisters"" sharing laughter and tears together.

I return to Washington, DC with even greater resolve to end our illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government. From Iraq to Libya and now in Syria, the U.S. has waged wars of regime change, each resulting in unimaginable suffering, devastating loss of life, and the strengthening of groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS.

I call upon Congress and the new Administration to answer the pleas of the Syrian people immediately and support the Stop Arming Terrorists Act. We must stop directly and indirectly supporting terrorists — directly by providing weapons, training and logistical support to rebel groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and ISIS; and indirectly through Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Turkey, who, in turn, support these terrorist groups. We must end our war to overthrow the Syrian government and focus our attention on defeating al-Qaeda and ISIS.
The U.S. must stop supporting terrorists who are destroying Syria and her people. The U.S. and other countries fueling this war must stop immediately. We must allow the Syrian people to try to recover from this terrible war.

Thank you,
Tulsi ""

100681426711941_1222837991162940,"#Syria | Pres al-#Assad: #Astana talks will focus on ceasefire and allowing terrorist groups to join reconciliation

President Bashar al-Assad gave an interview to the Japanese TBS TV channel in which he said the upcoming Astana talks will be about talking between the government and the terrorist groups in order to make ceasefire and to allow those terrorist groups to join the reconciliations in Syria.

The following is the full text of the interview:

Question 1: Thank you Mr. President, thank you for availing us of this opportunity to know your perspective of what is happening in Syria, and the future of this country. First of all, I have one question: now that the Astana talk nears, what do you seek and expect from this conference?

Astana talks focus on ceasefire

President Assad: First of all, you're most welcome in Damascus, and I am glad to speak to the Japanese audience for the first time during this war on Syria. We don't have expectations, let's say, we have hopes from Astana, that it's going to be a podium for talks between different Syrian parties regarding everything, but I think it's going to focus more at the very beginning – it's going to be the priority, as we see it – is about the ceasefire in different places in Syria in order to protect lives, to allow the humanitarian aid to reach different areas in Syria. It's not clear yet whether this meeting is going to be about any political dialogue, because it's not clear who's going to participate in it. So far, it's about talking between the government and the terrorist groups in order to make ceasefire and to allow those terrorist groups to join the reconciliations in Syria, which means giving up your armaments and having amnesty from the government. This is the only thing that we can expect in the meantime.

Question 2: And do you accept the formation of transitional government to be discussed in this conference?

Any discussion of formation of government should be based on constitution

President Assad: Anything that will be discussed should be based on the constitution, because it's not about the government and the opposition or the government and the terrorist groups; it's about every Syrian citizen who has the right to define the future of Syria. So, in our constitution there's nothing called transitional government. You can have regular government that represents different parties and different political entities in Syria. This is our proposition. So, yes, if anybody wants to join this government, what we call it national unity government, this is viable for every party outside or inside Syria, and after that government, you can talk about, let's say, legislative elections or parliamentarian elections, that would be followed by another government later, which is based on the results of the elections.

Question 3: New United States President Mr. Donald Trump is going to be inaugurated soon. What do you expect of Mr. Trump, and what kind of policy change do you expect from this?

We hope Trump be genuine in implementing his rhetoric on fighting terrorism

President Assad: As you know, he's one of few American presidents that weren't in politics before. Most of the previous presidents, they used to have certain kinds of political jobs or positions. This one is not so. If you read different media, even the American media, they look at him as unpredictable, because they know little about his vision. The only thing that we have that we can base our judgment upon is his rhetoric during the campaign, and if you want to pick up the thing that we can say that it's good in those rhetorics is our priority today, which is fighting the terrorism, and that's what he said, President Trump, he said that his priority is to fight ISIS. Of course, ISIS is one of the aspects of terrorism, one of the organizations; when you talk about ISIS you have to talk about al-Nusra, and you have so many Al Qaeda-affiliated groups now within Syria, but he meant by ISIS, I think, the terrorism, so I think this priority that he put is very important. So, we expect, and we hope, that the next administration will be genuine in implementing this rhetoric regarding the terrorism and help not only Syria, because the terrorism today is not a Syrian problem; it's a Middle Eastern and global problem. So, we hope that they are genuine to forge a real and realistic alliance to fight the terrorists in the region, and that of course will include Syria first of all.

Question 4: And I have read one interview in which you mentioned lobbies in Washington DC. They are disturbing the policy change, you think so?

There are lobbies in Washington that would impede any Trump's policy direction  

President Assad: It's very clear that the mainstream media, the different establishments, the different lobbies… this is one combination, one combination that they don't need to see any change, because they have their own interest in the policy of the United States, in the destructive policy of the United States that we've been seeing at least for the last nearly 17 years since George Bush came to power in 2000. We only see the United States launching a war, directly or indirectly through proxies, and those different companies, lobbies, media, they have interest in this kind of problems. It could be financial interest in most of the cases. So, it's very clear today that they are going to put obstacles and to impede any direction of the policy of the new President regarding either fighting terrorism or respecting the sovereignty of other countries, or even having detente around the world through the good relation with Russia, or with any other great power, like China, for example.

Question 5: In the course of the fight against the so-called Islamic State, would you seek coordination with players like Turkey, Kurds, and the United States?

Erdogan supports ISIS and al-Nusra on daily basis

President Assad: First of all, if you want to be very transparent, ISIS was created under the supervision of the United States, whether in Iraq in 2006; before it was ISIS, it was IS, Islamic State, it was in Iraq only, restricted to Iraq. Then when the conflict started in Syria, it became ISIS, of Syria and Iraq, and later Turkey sponsored this State, because they used to use the Syrian oil fields in order to export and to get money and to recruit more fighters, and Turkey was directly involved in the smuggling of oil, with the involvement and complicity of Erdogan himself with ISIS. So, we cannot expect to have genuine fight against ISIS by Turkey or the United States, and the recent, more stark example is the attack on Palmyra a few weeks ago, when they could retake Palmyra under the supervision of the Americans, under the surveillance of the American drones; they came through the desert and they occupied Palmyra. Today, we are talking, and ISIS has been attacking Deir Ezzor in the eastern part of Syria, and the Americans did nothing to stop ISIS. This is where the so-called international alliance against terrorism has been working for more than one year and a half now, and they achieved nothing, because they are not serious. For Turkey, Erdogan is Muslim Brotherhood, he's instinctively and innately sympathetic and linked and close and adhered to the ISIS and to Al Qaeda because they have the same ideology, he cannot be away from them. He tries to do some maneuvers, to show that he's against those terrorists, ISIS and al-Nusra, but actually on daily basis he supports those organizations, and without his support, they cannot survive.

Question 6: In Aleppo, and elsewhere, your armed forces and Russian forces have been criticized for bombing residential areas, quarters, and hospitals from air. Would you say those human tragedies were inevitable to liberate Aleppo?

Those who supported terrorists have no right to cry for Syrian citizens

President Assad: Actually, the ones who accused Russia and Syria about the bombardment or committing crimes and so on are the same countries who supported the terrorists, starting from the United States, UK, France, Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, and other similar countries. Those who supported the terrorists directly through the media, through the politics, and through sending armaments and money and every logistical support, have no right to cry for the Syrian citizens, because they are the reason why the Syrian civilians, innocent people, have been killed during the last six years. This is first.

Second, our role, as a government, by the constitution, by the law, and our moral obligation toward the Syrian people and the Syrian citizens, is to liberate them from the terrorists. Would anyone accept that a government would see any area in any country under the control of terrorists killing people and destroying everything and implementing their hateful ideology, the Wahabi ideology, on the people, and expect the government to stand by and watch? Of course, if you want to talk the casualties, every war has casualties, every war is a bad war. Every war has blood and killing, every war, any kind of war; you cannot talk about good war, this is self-evident. But if you have to resort to a war to fight terrorism, you will have casualties, unfortunately. We did our utmost not to have any casualties, but those who've been out crying for the civilians, did they present any shred of evidence about Syria killing civilians, or Russia? The other question: how can a government morally kill its own people? And if we kill our own people, the civilians, how can we withstand six years, as a government or as army or as President? This is not logical, this is not realistic. We are here because we have the public support. But at the end, as I said, there's always casualties, and we hope that we can really end this war as soon as possible; this is the only way that we can save Syrian blood through.

Question 7: Your force has been suspected to be using bombs containing chlorine gas. Would you deny it?

The Americans blocked Syria's request for UN delegation to investigate chemical weapons use because it is the terrorists who used chlorine gas

President Assad: Actually, you are talking about chemical weapons, talking about chemical weapons means killing thousands of people in very short time, something that hasn't happened in Syria since the beginning of the crisis. But the most important thing is that morally, as a government, you wouldn't do it, you wouldn't, as I just said, kill your own people, you wouldn't use mass destruction weapons against your own people, that's impossible. But third, which is more important, is that in 2013, we signed on the treaty of the banning of chemical weapons, and we gave up our arsenal of chemical weapons since 2013, and we don't have it anymore. But actually, the terrorists are the ones who used those kinds of armaments, the first time in 2013, and in the spring of 2013 we asked the United Nations to send a delegation for investigations, and the Americans blocked our attempt, because they knew that time that if the delegation came to Syria, it will find the concrete evidence that the terrorists have used chlorine gas against our soldiers. So, I will completely deny what's in this statement, which reflects the narrative, the Western narrative, regarding Syria, and this is part of demonizing the Syrian government and the Syrian Army.

Question 8: There are millions of refugees and IDPs, including small children, hundreds of thousands of deaths. How do you think of responsibility as President?

President Assad: Of course, when you talk about refugees, it's a tragedy, when you talk especially about children, young children, youths, they are innocent people, they don't have anything to do with this war, regardless of the affiliation. Actually, when you talk about children, they don't have any political affiliation; they are just innocent people, but they are the ones who pay the price before any other one in the society. So, you're talking about a tragedy we've been living with on daily basis. That's why that feeling that I'm talking about, that we live with every day, is the incentive for us as officials to do our utmost to get rid of the terrorists who created this problem, and to bring peace and stability back to Syria. That's the question that the Syrians ask to the President. Of course, as a Syrian, I'm sympathetic with every Syrian who suffered because of the war, but their question now is not what you feel; their question is what are you going to do? When are we going to get rid of those terrorists? But the most important aspect that many in the West and the world don't mention is that part of the refugees problem is not only related to the terrorists themselves; it's related to the embargo that's been implemented on the Syrian people by the West and their allies. This embargo didn't work against the government; it worked against every Syrian citizen, it affected the life of every Syrian citizen. That's why many refugees left their country, not only because of the threat of the terrorists, but actually because the basic needs of their life, of their livelihoods, are not available for them to continue their normal life, whether food, whether education, healthcare, anything, it's not available anymore, so they have to leave Syria to live somewhere else to live the minimum of the life that anyone would seek.

Question 9: Then, in course of the peacemaking process, would you consider your resignation as an option, when you think it's necessary for reconciliation?

President Assad: The resignation of the President or the continuation of that President in his position is a national issue, it's related to every Syrian, because in Syria the President would be elected directly by the Syrian people, so this is not the right of the government or the right of the opposition; it's the right of every Syrian, so the only decision-maker in that regard is the ballot box. Whoever wants the President to leave, they can go to the ballot box and say ""no, we don't want him."" This is the democracy everywhere in the world. So, no, it's not something we discuss either with the opposition or with any other country. This is a Syrian issue, and this is part of the constitution, it's related to the constitution. When we have election, or could be early election – it's not on the table now – but this is the only way to say whether I have to leave or not. Again, I'm not the reason of the problem. As President, I have to help my country during the crisis, not to flee, not to escape, not to say ""I have to leave and let the people fend for themselves."" No, this is not the solution. In the crisis, the President should be at the helm, should take care of the crisis, then after the crisis is finished, he can say maybe he wants to stay or wants to leave, and this is where the Syrian people would tell him ""stay"" or ""no, you have to leave, we don't want you anymore.""

Question 10: What role would you expect Japan to play in peacemaking and rebuilding Syria; reconstruction and rebuilding Syria, Japan's role?

We hope Japan will go back to the Japan we used to know in terms of respecting international law

President Assad: Let me be frank with as a Japanese guest in Syria: since our independence, since the launching of the relation between Syria and Japan decades ago, Japan played a very important and vital role in the development of different countries including Syria; supporting the infrastructure, etc. And Japan was always unbiased regarding the different issues concerning the Middle East. It always respected the international law till the beginning of this crisis it was the first time for Japan to breach this trend when they say that the Syrian President should go. The question: is it based on the values and morals of the Japanese people? Definitely not. Everybody knows how morally-motivated the Japanese citizens are, everybody knows it. Is it based on the international law? No, we are sovereign country, we are an independent country, no one in the world has the right to say who should stay and who should go. Unfortunately, that was in line with the American and Western policy. Again, Japan joined the embargo on Syria, Japan used to help the Syrian people. Is the embargo on the Syrian people related to anything regarding the interests of the Japanese people or their values or their laws, or their constitution or anything? I don't think so. So, how can Japan play that role while they don't have embassy so they don't see what's going on here? Actually, politically, they are blind like so many Western countries that they don't have any relation with our government or with our country, so they cannot play any role because they don't know what's going on. Their information is coming from Western countries, which is absurd for us. Reconstruction of Syria, you cannot talk about reconstruction while you are making an embargo; you cannot give me the food with one hand and take it from me with the other hand. So, it's about the politics of the Japan; they have to go back to the international law, we are sovereign country, they always respected Syria, and we expect them to go back to that line that distinguished Japan from most of the countries around the world. This is where Japan can, of course, definitely, play an important and vital role regarding the peace and saving blood, and the reconstruction of Syria to help those people. Most of the refugees, they don't need somebody to tell them ""you're welcome"" to Germany or to France or to any other country; they want to go back to their country, they don't want you to help them there, they want you to help them here. That's how we see the role of Japan in the future, and we have hope that Japan will go back to the Japan that we used to know during the previous decades.

Journalist: As you know, Japan has experience and role in nation building seventy years ago, Japan may advice to your country's rebuilding and reconstruction.

President Assad: Definitely, of course. We hope so.

Question 11: As you know Japanese journalist Jumpei Yasuda, he's very capable journalist, he's my friend, has been captured in Syria since June 2015. Do you have any information of his whereabouts and situation?

The Turks are the ones who have information about Jabhat al-Nusra's capture of Japanese journalist  

President Assad: Till this moment no, we don't have any information about him. We feel sorry about this and we are, as Syrians, the ones who can understand the feeling of his family, because we have so many missings in Syria; many Syrians have been missed during this war, and we understand the feeling of his family, and we feel sorry for that. But if there is any information, I would have given it to you.

Journalist: He is kept hostage by al-Nusra Front.

President Assad: I think the one who can help in bringing the information are the Turks, because they are the supervisors of al-Nusra; they must have every information al-Nusra have, with their intelligence and their government.

Journalist: And has Japanese government contacted your government?

President Assad: Unfortunately, no. There is not a single contact between the Syrian government and the Japanese government regarding any subject, including this Japanese journalist, who is a Japanese citizen at the end.

Question 12: You defined the Japanese role through their… Japan is belonging, you think, belonging to the coalition member of the United State, you think?

President Assad: In Syria?

Journalist: Yeah.

President Assad: But the question: what did that coalition achieved, actually, nothing. ISIS was expanding since the beginning of the airstrikes, which were cosmetic airstrikes, I'm being very frank with you, till the Russians intervened against ISIS, the end of September 2015, where ISIS started to shrink. So, that coalition achieved nothing; they only killed Syrian soldiers who have been fighting ISIS in that area, they destroy the infrastructure of the Syrians that has been built during the last seventy years since the independence, in every sector of that infrastructure, whether the oil fields, schools, bridges, refineries, everything has been destroyed by that coalition. This is the only achievement of that coalition, unfortunately.

Question 13: Your plan to rebuild this country, how long does it take? Your timetable?

President Assad: We have started before the end of the crisis, we put the plans and we started with suburbs around Damascus and now we are planning in Aleppo and other cities to reconstruct new suburbs that's been destroyed, but in a modern way. So, we haven't waited, and we are not going to wait till the end of the crisis; we can start right away, as the Syrian people are determined to rebuild their country. We built Syria, Syria was not built by any foreigners; we built it with our engineers, with our labors, with our own resources, with the help of some friends – financial help, not technical help. So, we have the ability to rebuild Syria. It takes time because it needs a lot of money. The Syrians, every Syrian is going to build his own house according to his resources even if it is limited, you have expatriates, you have the refugees who left Syria, some of them are in good condition, they want to come back, and with the support of our friends Russia, China, and Iran. Many other countries started discussing the reconstruction of Syria, and they're going to help with their financial resources. So, you have so many resources to rebuild Syria. It's not about time; it will take time. Any reconstruction will take time, but the most important thing is that you have the ability to rebuild your country. We are not worried about that. What we are worried about is how can we rebuild the minds of the people that have been under the control of ISIS and al-Nusra for many years; that their minds have been polluted because of the instilled ideology in their minds, this, as I said, as I called it, hateful or Wahhabi Ideology. They saw the death and the killing, and some of the children killed with their hands innocent people. How can we rebuild those minds, or rehabilitate those minds? That's our big concern after the crisis.

Journalist: Thank you, thank you so much.

President Assad: Thank you.

17 Jan, 2017 

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he has no grounds to attack or protect US President-elect Donald Trump, since he does not know him personally. He added though that those behind the recent allegations against Trump have ""no moral scruples."" 

""I don't know Mr. Trump personally, I have never met him and don't know what he will do on the international arena. So I have no grounds to attack him or criticize him for anything, or protect him or whatever,"" Putin said.

Despite the fact that elections in the US are over and ended with a ""solid win"" for the Republican candidate, an intense political struggle continues in the US, the Russian president observed, adding that there are certain forces that aim ""to undermine the legitimacy of the president-elect.""

""I have an impression they practiced in Kiev and are ready to organize a Maidan in Washington, just to not let Trump take office,"" Putin said, apparently referring to anti-government protests in the Ukrainian capital in 2014, which resulted in the leadership being ousted.

Those anti-Trump forces in the US also want to ""bind hand and foot"" the newly-elected leader, Putin added. He said that in this way, they aim to interfere with the domestic and international policies outlined in Trump's presidential campaign.

By doing so, these forces ""severely harm US interests,"" Putin said.
The campaign to discredit the president-elect shows that certain ""political elites in the West, including in the US,"" have ""significantly"" worsened, according to the Russian president.

""Prostitution is an ugly social phenomenon,"" he told reporters, adding that people who stand behind ""fabrications"" being used against Trump ""are worse than prostitutes.""
""They have no moral scruples,"" he said.
The Russian leader also called the allegations that Moscow might have blackmail material on the US president-elect ""evidently fake.""

""When Trump visited Moscow several years ago, he wasn't a political figure. We didn't even know about his political ambitions, he was just a businessman, one of America's richest people. So does someone think that our intelligence services go after each American billionaire? Of course not, it's complete rubbish,"" Putin said.

Commenting on reports spread in the Western media accusing Trump of frolicking with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, the Russian president said he doubted that a man who had been organizing beauty pageants for years and had met ""some of the most beautiful women of the world"" would hire call girls in the Russian capital.
Last week, a report on what was claimed to be a secret dossier, reportedly compiled by former UK intelligence officer Christopher Steele, was published by CNN and BuzzFeed. It alleged that Trump was groomed and supported by Russian intelligence and that the Kremlin was in possession of compromising material on the president-elect.

Russian Defense Ministry said that the international humanitarian organizations did not provide any real assistance to Aleppo residents though the city has been liberated from terrorism and terrorists for a month already.

Spokesman of the Defense Ministry Major General Igor Konashenkov said Saturday in a statement ""Surprisingly, after the period of super-close attention to Aleppo from international organizations, involved in humanitarian demining, a month later there are no initiatives to offer assistance to the people in that city.""
""Is the UN authority on demining and the Geneva international center for humanitarian demining aware of the fact working in Aleppo since mid-December does not risk lives, and all roads to the city are absolutely free and safe? They do know, for sure,"" Konashenkov added.

""This is also well known to UNISEF representatives and to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which are the UN key bodies for assistance to children and adults, who suffer from military actions"", he said.

Konashenkov pointed out that the Russian Coordination Center, International Committee of the Red Cross and Syrian Arab Red Crescent provide the basic needs including medicines, food, potable water and clothes to Aleppo residents regularly.

Engineering units of the Syrian Army worked in cooperation with the Russian experts on combing the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo city in preparation for the return of residents to their houses after the city was liberated from terrorists on 22nd December of the past year.

9 January، 2017

Following is the full context of the statement:

Question1:Mr. President, you have just met a French delegation of MPs. Do you think this visit will have an influence on the French position about Syria?

President Assad:This is a French question. We hope that any delegation that would come here is to see the truth about what is happening in Syria during the last years, since the beginning of the war six years ago, and the problem now, regarding France in particular, is that they don't have an embassy, they don't have any relation with Syria at all, so it's like… we can say it's a blind state. How can you forge a policy towards a certain region if you can't see, if you're blind? You need to see. The importance of those delegations is that they represent the eyes of the states, but that depends on the state; do they want to see, or they want to keep adopting the ostrich policy and they don't want to tell the truth, because now everything in the world is changing regarding Syria on every level, the local, the regional, and the international. Until this moment, the French administration hasn't changed its position, they still speak the old language which is disconnected from our reality. That's why we have a hope that there's someone in the state who wants to listen to these delegations, to the facts. I'm not talking about my opinion, I'm talking about the reality in Syria. So, we have hope.

Question 2:Mr. President, you said that Aleppo is a major victory for Syria, and a major turn in the crisis. What do you feel when you see the pictures of the hundreds of civilians that were killed in the bombings, and the devastation of the city?
President Assad:Of course, it's very painful for us as Syrians to see any part of our country destroyed, or to see any blood shedding anywhere,this is self-evident, this is emotional part, but for me as President or as an official, the question for the Syrian people: what I'm going to do. It's not only about the feeling; the feeling is self-evident as I said. How we're going to rebuild our cities.

Question 3:But was the bombing of east Aleppo the only solution to retake the city, with the death of civilians, your fellow citizens?
President Assad:It depends on what kind of war you're looking for. Are you looking for a quiet war, war without destruction? I haven't heard, in the history, of a good war, every war is bad. Why bad? Because every war is about destruction, every war is about the killing, that's why every war is bad. You cannot say ""this is a good war"" even if it's for a good reason, to defend your country, for a noble reason, but it's bad. That's why it's not the solution, if you have any other solution. But the question is: how can you liberate the civilians in those areas from the terrorists? Is it better to leave them, to leave them under their supervision, under their oppression, under their fate defined by those terrorists by beheading, by killing, by everything but not having state? Is that the role of the state, just to keep and watch? You have to liberate, and this is the price sometimes, but at the end, the people are liberated from the terrorists. That's the question now; are they liberated or not? If yes, that's what we have to do.

Question 4:Mr. President, a ceasefire has been signed on the 30th of December, why do Syrian Army still fight near Damascus in the region of Wadi Barada?

President Assad:First of all, ceasefire is about different parties, so when you say there's viable ceasefire is when every party stops fighting and shooting, and it's not the case in many areas in Syria, and that was reported by the Russian center of observation regarding the ceasefire. There's breaching of that ceasefire on daily basis in Syria, including Damascus, but in Damascus mainly because the terrorists occupy the main source of water of Damascus where more than five million civilians are deprived from water for the last three weeks now, and the role of the Syrian Army is to liberate that area in order to prevent those terrorists from using that water in order to suffocate the capital. So, that's why.

Question 5:Mr. President, Daesh is not a part of the ceasefire…
President Assad: No.

Journalist: Do you plan to take again Raqqa, and when?
President Assad: Let me just continue the second part of the first question. Second part of that ceasefire is not about al-Nusra and ISIS, and the area that we've been fighting to liberate recently, regarding the water sources of the capital Damascus, is occupied by al-Nusra, and al-Nusra announced formally that they are occupying that area. So, it's not part of the ceasefire.

Regarding al-Raqqa, of course it's our mission, according to the constitution and according to the laws, that we have to liberate every inch of the Syrian land. There's no question about that, it's not to be discussed. But it's about when, what are our priorities, and this is military, regarding to the military planning, about the military priorities. But nationally, there's no priority; every inch is a Syrian inch, it should be within the purview of the government.

Question 6:Important talks will take place in Astana at the end of the month, including a lot of Syrian parties, including some opposition groups, let's say. What are you ready to negotiate directly with them, and what are you ready to negotiate to help the peace to come back in Syria.

President Assad:Of course, we are ready, and we announced that our delegation to that conference is ready to go when they define… when they set the time of that conference. We are ready to negotiate everything. When you talk about negotiation regarding whether to end the conflict in Syria or talking about the future of Syria, anything, it's fully open, there's no limit for that negotiations. But who's going to be there from the other side? We don't know yet. Is it going to be real Syrian opposition – and when I say ""real"" it means has grassroots in Syria, not Saudi one or French one or British one – it should be Syrian opposition to discuss the Syrian issues. So, the viability or, let's say, the success of that conference will depend on that point.

Question 7:Are you even ready to discuss your position as President? That has been contested.

President Assad:Yeah, but my position is related to the constitution, and the constitution is very clear about the mechanism in which you can bring a president or get rid of a president. So, if they want to discuss this point, they have to discuss the constitution, and the constitution is not owned by the government or the president or by the opposition; it should be owned by the Syrian people, so you need a referendum for every constitution. This is one of the points that could be discussed in that meeting, of course, but they cannot say ""we need that president"" or ""we don't need that president"" because the president is related to the ballot box. If they don't need him, let's go to the ballot box. The Syrian people should bring a president, not part of the Syrian people.

Question 8:And with this negotiation, what will be the fate of rebel fighters?

President Assad:From what we've been implementing during the last three years, because you want genuinely to have peace in Syria, the government offered amnesty for every militant who gives up his armaments, and it worked, and they still have the same option if they want to go back to their normality and to go back to their normal life. This is the maximum that you can offer, amnesty.

Question 9:Mr. President, as you know, French presidential election will take place, do you have a favorite, do you have a preference for one of the candidates?

President Assad:No, because we don't have any contacts with any one of them, and we cannot count very much on the statements and rhetoric during the campaign, so we always say let's wait and see what policy they're going to adopt after they are in their position. But we always have hopes that the next administration or government or president, they want to deal with the reality, to disconnect themselves from the disconnected policy from our reality. That's our hope, and they can work for the interest of the French people, because the question now after six years: as a French citizen, do you feel safer? I don't think the answer is yes. The immigration problem, has it made the situation in your country better? I think the answer is no, whether in France or in Europe. The question now: what is the reason? This is the discussion that the next administration or government or president should deal with in order to deal with our reality, not with their imaginations as has been happening during the last six years.

Question 10:But one of the candidates, Francois Fillon, doesn't have the same position as the official one; he would like to reestablish the dialogue with Syria. Do you expect his election – if he's elected – could change the position of France about Syria?

President Assad:His rhetoric regarding the terrorists, or let's say the priority to fight the terrorists and not meddling in the affairs of other countries, are welcome, but we have to be cautious, because what we've learned in this region during the last few years is that many officials would say something and do the opposite. I wouldn't say that Mr. Fillon would do this. I hope not. But we have to wait and see, because there's no contact. But so far, what he said, if it's implemented, that will be very good.

Question 11:Do you appreciate him as a politician, Francois Fillon?

President Assad:I didn't have any contact with him or cooperation, so whatever I say now won't be very credible, to be frank with you.

Question 12:Is there a message you want to address to France?

President Assad:I think if I want to send it to the politicians, I will say the self-evident thing; that you have to work for the interest of the Syrian citizens, and for the last six years the situation is going in the other direction, because the French politics harmed the French interests. So, for the French people, I would say the mainstream media has failed in most of the West. The narrative has been debunked because of the reality, and you have the alternative media, you have to look for the truth. The truth was the main victim of the events in the Middle East, including Syria. I would ask any citizen in France to search for the reality, for the real information, through the alternative media. When they search for this information, they can be more effective in dealing with their government, or at least not allowing some politicians to base their politics on lies. That's what we think is the most important thing during the last six years.

Question 13:Mr. President, your father has been a lifelong President of Syria. Do you consider the option of not being the President anymore, one day?

President Assad:Yeah, that depends on two things: the first one is the will of the Syrian people; do they want that person to be president or not. If I want to be president while the Syrian people doesn't want me, even if I win in the elections, I don't have strong support, I cannot achieve anything, especially in a complicated region like Syria. You cannot be just elected president, that doesn't work, you need popular support. Without it I cannot be successful. So, at that time, there's no meaning to be president.

The second one; if I have that feeling that I want to be president, I will nominate myself, but that depends on the first factor. If I feel that the Syrian people doesn't want me, of course I wouldn't be. So, it's not about me mainly, it's about the Syrian people; do they want me or not. That's how I look at it.

Question 14:Last question; Donald Trump is to be appointed as President of the United States in less than two weeks. He has been clear that he wants to improve relationships with Russia, which is one of your main allies…

President Assad: Yeah, exactly.

Journalist: Do you consider… do you expect that it will change the position of the United States towards Syria?

President Assad: Yeah, if you want to talk realistically, because the Syrian problem is not isolated, it's not only Syrian-Syrian; actually, the biggest part… or let's say the major part of the Syrian conflict is regional and international. The simplest part that you can deal with is the Syrian-Syrian part. The regional and the international part depends mainly on the relation between the United States and Russia. What he announced yesterday was very promising, if there's a genuine approach or initiative toward improving the relation between the United States and Russia, that will effect every problem in the world, including Syria. So, I would say yes, we think that's positive, regarding the Syrian conflict.

Journalist: What is positive?

President Assad: I mean the relation, the improvement of the relation between the United States and Russia will reflect positively on the Syrian conflict.

Journalists: Thank you very much.

Al Qaeda groups plan multiple front attacks to strengthen #Erdogan's hand in #Astana talks over Syria.

Media sources disclosed that terrorist groups are getting ready to launch massive attack on the Syrian Army and its allies in, at least 3, provinces with the support of the Turkish intelligence service.

The Arabic language al-Akhbar reported that based on field information, Ankara-backed terrorists are developing plans in close coordination with the Turkish intelligence service to relaunch large-scale attacks on army positions in Housing Project 1070, Jam'iyat al-Zahra and Zahiyeh al-Assad in the Western part of Aleppo city.

Terrorists of al-Tukistani, deployed in two regions of al-Has and Tal (hill) al-Dhaman that overlook Khanasser-Hama road, are also readying to attack the army's defense lines and cut off the road from central provinces and Damascus to Aleppo.

The preparations made for anti-government assault are not limited to Aleppo and Idlib, and the Turkey-backed terrorists in areas near the towns of Souran, Ma'an and al-Tamanna in Northern Hama are also doing the same stationing new missile launchers, deploying more equipment and digging long trenches in the region to pave the ground for an imminent attack.

A high-ranking security source in the operations room of Syria's allies disclosd on Thursday that Turkey and al-Nusra Front (recently renamed to Fatah al-Sham Front) have increased contacts in recent days to pressure Russia through certain joint moves in Idlib to make concessions in Astana peace talks.

The source underlined that al-Nusra Front was preparing for several attacks, ordered by Turkey, to weaken the ceasefire.

Ankara also called on the terrorists to launch different attacks on several points so that Russia would be forced to make concessions in Astana negotiations.

The source added that Turkey aimed to persuade the terrorists to show hostile behavior towards the Syrian army to pressure Russia and find a place for al-Nusra Front in the peace talks.

Reports said that senior Turkish military officers were deployed in Western Aleppo and Idlib and coordinate operations with al-Nusra commanders, adding that cooperation between the ISIL and al-Nusra Front would also be witnessed in Syria in the near future.

100681426711941_1211596798953726,"Pres al-#Assad: #France's policy on #Syria is disconnected from reality of war and has helped inflame situation

President Bashar al-Assad said on Sunday France's current policy is disconnected from the reality of the war in Syria, stressing that this policy has helped inflame the situation through the support provided to the terrorist organizations, which have turned into a threat not only to the peoples of the region, but to the peoples of the Western countries as well.

His remarks came during a meeting with a French delegation, including a number of members of the French National Assembly and a number of intellectuals, headed by Thiery Mariani. 

The President was assured on the safety of the delegation members after the terrorist attack they came under in the vicinity of Aleppo International Airport, noting that the Syrian people have been, since the outset of the war on Syria, facing similar attacks by the terrorist organizations that are supported by regional and western countries.

He added that these attacks have already claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Syrians and destroyed infrastructure in the country.

President al-Assad pointed out that the delegation's visit and what they have come to see during their tours, especially in Aleppo, would help them create realistic views about the crimes committed by the terrorists against the Syrian people.

This idea was echoed by the visiting French figures, who said their visit to Syria in general and to Aleppo in particular, especially at the current time, has provided a real opportunity to come to know what the Syrian people have been subjected to during the ongoing war. 

They affirmed that what they saw on the ground stresses that there has been substantial improvement of the situation, which proves the ability of the Syrian people and army to restore security and stability and continue to stand their ground firmly in the face of terrorism.

They added that the Western public opinion, particularly in France, has become aware that the picture they receive about what is going on in the region and Syria is not realistic and includes plenty of falsification, expressing their will to help the public opinion reach the real picture of what is happening on the ground without distortion.

For her part, Speaker of the People's Assembly Hadiyeh Abbas affirmed during her meeting with the delegation that the French government is called on to review its stances towards Syria, adding that France should be one of the countries that fight terrorism instead of supporting it.

""We count on the French parliamentarians to convey the truth to French people whom their government seeks to mislead,"" she said.

About the delegation meeting with President al-Assad, Thiery Mariani said that the members of the delegation totally agreed with what President al-Assad said, adding that ""we are sure about the strength and the wisdom of President Assad who represents Syria.""

Commenting on the delegation's visit to Aleppo, Mariani pointed out that the delegation inspected the situation in the city and listened to the locals and displaced people in the temporary housing centers who spoke about the crimes committed by terrorists against citizens which forced them to leave their houses, adding that the citizens of Aleppo are determined to rebuild their city.

He pointed out that any victory achieved by Syria against terrorism protects the French people as terrorism which targets Syria is the same which targets France.
""We hope that the upcoming Syrian dialogue that will be held in the Kazakhstan Capital of Astana will lead to a political solution for the crisis in Syria,"" Mariani said.

He hoped that there will be a major change in the French policy towards Syria following the upcoming French presidential election, adding that ""we will lobby for reopening embassies between the two countries so as to ensure the return of the bilateral relations back to normal.""

In a press statement following the meeting, Mariani affirmed that the delegation observed during the visit to Aleppo the satisfaction and happiness among the people of the city as a result of the return of security and stability to Aleppo and the exit of terrorists from it.

He pointed to the lies and fabrications promoted by international media outlets about the destruction of Aleppo and the killing of all its citizens, saluting the Syrian Arab Army in Aleppo because ""any victory for Syria is a victory for France.""

Brennan is largely responsible for the chaos in Syria. 
He and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter were against the ceasefire. Ashton Carter sent his air force to scuttle the ceasefire that was agreed to between Kerry and Lavrov in September. So for Brennan to shed crocodile tears now, well I might say, it's giving hypocrisy a bad name.'

During the meeting, stress was placed on the achievements made in the two countries in terms of the war against terrorism, with the most recent ones being the expelling of terrorists from Aleppo in Syria and the advance of Iraqi forces in Mosul.

Both sides affirmed that these achievements represent a victory for the two brotherly people of Syria and Iraq as they share the same enemy, which is terrorism and its destructive Takfiri ideology.

President al-Assad and al-Fayad also highlighted the importance of concerted efforts of all countries in the fight against terrorism as the outcome of this war will not only influence the shaping of the future of the region, but will also have its impacts on the whole world, especially that terrorism knows no boundaries, a fact that was proved through the terrorist attacks that have hit many of the countries in the region and beyond.

He criticized the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's claims regarding violations made to the cessation of hostilities agreement in Syria, adding that Turkey should put pressure on the armed groups instead of accusing others of breaking the agreement.

The events on ground and field reports reveal Turkey's continuous support to the terrorist organizations in Syria through arming terrorists, training them and facilitating their infiltration into the Syrian territories, he added.

Qasemi concluded that Iran emphasizes serious implementation of the cessation of hostilities agreement, expecting Turkish officials to refuse taking the stances which will be contrary to the existing realities and commitments of the country.

ŞAM – Suriye'nin güvenlik ve istikrarı uğruna canını feda eden ordu ve güvenlik güçlerinin fedakarlıklarına takdirlerini vurgulamak ve ulusal bağımsızlık kararına bağlılıklarını dile getirmek için Şam'ın Sebibahrat Meydanında bu gece düzenlenen mumlu yürüyüşe binlerce vatandaş katıldı.

Yüzlerce mumun ve meşalenin ışığı altında vatan uğruna şehit düşen pilotlar için düzenlenen bir dakikalık saygı duruşundan sonra kalabalık halk kitlesi, Suriye'nin hedef alan komploya karşı mücadele yürüten kahraman askerlerin yanında yer aldıklarını, Cumhurbaşkanı Beşşar el-Esad ile reformlara bağlılıklarını ve milli birliğe tutunduklarını vurgulayan sloganlar attı.

Devrim Gençliği Birliği Şam Şubesi Başkanı Fadi Hasan yaptığı açıklamada, bugünkü gösterinin özellikle silahlı terör gruplarının hain eylemleri neticesinde şehit edilen pilotlar başta olmak üzere ordu ve güvenlik güçlerinden şehitlerin ruhuna saygı mesajı taşıdığını kaydetti.

Gösterinin, Suriye gençlerinin tabii bir tepkisi olduğunu ifade eden Hasan, gençlerin, vatana karşı yürütülen komploya karşı koyma ve silahlı terör gruplarına karşı askerlerle aynı safta yer almaya hazır olduğunu ekledi.

Medyacı Mike Fegali de açıklamasında Suriye'de krizin sonlarına yaklaşıldığını söyleyerek, ""Semavi dinlerin geleneklerine dayanan bir hoşgörü ülkesi, her zaman Arap ve yabancı komplocuların gözünde bir diken olarak kalacaktır"" dedi.

Gösteriye katılanlardan Lübnanlı Gazeteci Kerim el-Abid de, Cumhurbaşkanı el-Esad yönetiminde reformlara sahip çıkmak için her gün alanlara inen Suriye halkına selamlarını sundu.

Katılımcılardan Zekeriye Urfalı da, ""Suriye, toprağı, yönetimi ve halkıyla birdir, tek yürektir"" diyerek, halkın ulusal birliğin yanı sıra direniş seçeneğinden vazgeçmeyeceğini ve her türlü dış müdahaleyi reddettiğini ifade etti.

Hama ilinden gelerek gösteriye katılan Musa İbrahim de, bazı Arap ülkelerinin Suriye'yi sırtından bıçakladığını Suriye halkının ebediyen unutmayacağını vurgulayarak, ülkelerinde ABD üslerini barındırarak başka topraklara karşı düşmanlığı kolaylaştıranların bir gün hesap vereceğini söyledi.

Açıklamada bulunan birçok katılımcı, toplumun birçok kesiminden hatta il dışından gelerek gösterilere katılanların, Suriye halkının hain komployu alaşağı etmedeki hırsını gözler önüne serdiğini dile getirirken, kışkırtıcı medya kanallarına ve Suriye'ye karşı dünya çapında yürütülen dezenformasyon ve kışkırtma hamlelerine lanet okudu.

Gösteri esnasında Udey Ömer adlı çocuk vatan türkülerinden birini seslendirirken, Sanatçı Hadi Bakdunes, kemanla seslendirdiği vatansever şarkıların ezgileri eşliğinde binlerce kişiyi coşturdu.

Syrian border patrol injured several people as they fired on the intruders in the border province of Idlib, causing the terror group of 35 to retreat back into Turkey. Once inside Turkish territory, the wounded received aid from the Turkish army, says the news agency.  The border patrol suffered no losses.  A rebel defector squad, the Free Syrian Army, is believed to be smuggling fighters and weapons into Syria from Turkey along with other opponents of the Assad regime, to launch attacks on Assad's forces.

Gerçek durumu anlamak ve bu çelişkileri ortadan kaldırmak üzere, Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi daha önce Sayın Faruk Loğoğlu başkanlığında bir milletvekili heyetimizi Suriye'ye göndermişti. Heyet batı medyası kaynaklı haberlerin, gerçek durumu yansıtmaktan uzak olduğu bilgisini vermişti. Geçtiğimiz günlerde de, Suriye Kadınlar Birliği, durumu yerinde görmek üzere Türk kadınlarına bir davet çıkardı. Bu davete uyarak 30 Ekim – 2 Kasım 2011 tarihleri arasında dört gün süre ile Türkiye'den, 7'si CHP'den olmak üzere, 38 kişilik bir kadın heyeti ile Suriye'de incelemeler yaptık.

Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi heyeti, çalışmalarını, CHP Genel Başkan Yardımcısı ve İzmir Milletvekili Prof. Dr. Birgül Ayman Güler başkanlığında, CHP İzmir Milletvekili Prof. Dr. Hülya Güven, CHP Tekirdağ Milletvekili Dr. Candan Yüceer, Türk Kadınlar Birliği Genel Başkanı ve CHP Parti Meclisi Üyesi Avukat Sema Kendirci Uğurman, CHP Kadın Kolları Genel Sekreteri Seniye Nazik Işık, CHP Isparta Milletvekili Ali Haydar Öner'in eşi eğitimci Saadet Şen Öner ve CHP Hatay Merkez ilçe Kadın Kolları Başkanı Bilgen Durmaz ile yürüttü.

Suriye'de bulunduğumuz süre içinde Halep, Şam ve Lazkiye kentlerinde panel, konferans, çalışma grupları, resmi ziyaretler ve çarşı-pazar gezileri yaptık.

Suriye'de sıcak ve içten karşılandık. Mevcut iktidarın halka dönük olarak uyguladığı her hangi bir vahşet ya da kardeş kavgası olmadığını çıplak gözle gördük. Ülkenin belli bölgelerinde boru hatlarıyla demiryollarını havaya uçurmak dahil, çeşitli kabul edilemez kanlı terör saldırıları olduğu bilgisini edindik. Bu saldırılar ve bu saldırganları destekleyen güçlerin, hem yönetimde hem de halkta gerilim ve yüksek düzeyde endişe yarattığını gözledik.

Görüşmelerde en çok duyduğumuz cümleler şunlar oldu: ""Recep Tayyip Erdoğan neden böyle yaptı. Aramızda 57 anlaşma yapmıştık. Neredeyse aramızdaki sınırı kaldıracak kadar yakınlaşmıştık. Türkiye bizim günlük yaşamımızın içindeydi. Örneğin üzerimizdeki elbiseler Türkiye'den gelmişti. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan neden değişti, anlamadık.""

Suriye'de sık sık dile getirilen dilek, ""Biz düşman değiliz, Tayyip Erdoğan başkanlığındaki Türk Hükümeti terör gruplarına destek vermesin."" dileğidir.

Suriyelilerin, Hatay ilimiz sınırları içindeki Yayladağı, Altınözü ve Reyhanlı' da konuşlanan kamplara ilişkin çeşitli iddiaları vardı. Bazılarının gerçek olabileceğine inanmadığımız bu iddiaları araştırmak bizim görevimizdir. Söz konusu kaplarda yerinde inceleme yapmak ve gerekli gördüğümüz taktirde TBMM'nde araştırma komisyonu kurulması için gerekli çalışmaları yapmak kararındayız.

Suriye'nin geçmişte Türkiye'ye çok şeye mal olan PKK terörüne destek verdiğini biliyoruz. Ama aynı yanlışı bizim de yapmamız gerekmez.

İzlenimimiz, Kuzey Afrika ve Ortadoğu'nun diğer ülkelerinde de olduğu gibi, bazı güçler tarafından Senaryo yazıldığı, oyun kurulduğu, bu çerçevede ülkelerin iç işlerine karışıldığı ve sonunda ülkelerin acımasızca işgal edildiğidir.

İçinde yaşadığımız yüzyılda böyle bir yöntem artık kabul edilemez. Milyonlarca insanın kaderi ile böyle sorumsuzca oynanamaz.

Ülkelerin kendilerini yönetme hakkı, içeride egemen dışarıda bağımsız olma hakkı ortadan kaldırılamaz. Sözde küresel dünya sistemi aklını yitirmiş gibi bölgemizi ve aslında tüm dünyayı ateşe sürüklemektedir. Türkiye bu ateşten hem kendini hem de komşularını sakınmak zorundadır.

Western propaganda networks, including BBC, CNN, and Al Jazeera and contrived ""human rights advocacy"" fronts fully funded by corporate-financier special interests have been caught fabricating in whole, stories of atrocities being perpetrated by the Assad government. One activist reported by Soros-funded Amnesty International (page 10) to have been ""brutally murdered in custody"" turned up alive and well. Amnesty International would later reveal just how tenuous the information was behind what was essentially baseless, sensationalized propaganda aimed at the Syrian government. After a failed UN resolution, vetoed outright by Russia and China, and receiving no votes from other BRIC nations, more desperate measures are sure to follow, including the increasing prospect of unilateral military action taken by Turkey, on behalf of NATO and its corporate sponsors.

100681426711941_115993318514085,"Saudi Arabia has been funneling money and arms to the anti-Assad insurgents, and with the help of Jordan's intelligence service, the Saudis have also dispatched small Sunni fundamentalist contingents from Iraq and Lebanon into Syria to help the opposition forces (the Saudis have been building up Sunni militias in Iraq and Lebanon to counter the rising power of the Shi'as in these countries).
Those who have closely followed the events in Syria these past few months have noticed that sometime in late summer, the Syrian government began to report a growing number of attacks on Syrian military and police, and the growing toll these attacks have inflicted on government forces. These attacks were not perpetrated by un-armed civilian demonstrators.
Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, is aware of what is going on, and the other day in Moscow, without naming any countries, he said: ""There are more and more weapons that are being smuggled in from neighboring countries…. Today I saw a television report about some new so-called rebel Free Syrian Army organizing an attack on the government building, on the building belonging to Syria's armed forces…. This was quite similar to a true civil war.""
We have so far witnessed the first two stages of the anti-Assad campaign: civilian demonstrations and Saudi-financed and equipped armed insurgency. The news from the region indicate that we are now witnessing the third stage of the of the campaign to topple the regime: organizing defecting soldiers and military units into the so-called Free Syrian Army (FSA). We may soon begin to see the fourth and final stage of the campaign: Turkish intervention.
Yesterday, FSA units used mortars and rocket-propelled grenades to attack a government security compound outside Damascus. Col. Riad al-As'ad, the leader of the FSA – the result of the merger of two groups of defecting soldiers – says that he now has twenty-two battalions under his command. Military observers say these numbers appear to be on the high side, but agree that more and more Sunni soldiers and officers have defected from the Syrian military, taking their light arms with them. If the Saudis direct some of their military aid to the FSA, it may well become a force to contend with.
Turkey appears to be inching closer to intervening in Syria. One component of the anti-Assad coalition, the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, has openly called on Turkey to use its military to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, and ""buffer zones,"" or Turkish-protected enclaves, where anti-regime forces could gather without fear of attacks by the regime.",,status,,2011-11-19 19:50:56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Arap ülkeleri 2 Kasım günü toplandılar ve Suriye'ye bir takım önerilerde bulundular. Siyasi tutukluların serbest bırakılması, muhaliflere af çıkartılması ve reformlar yapılması vb. gibi.
Suriye önerileri kabul etti. Muhaliflere hemen bir çağrı yaptı ve ""Silahlarınızı hemen teslim edin"" dedi. Cinayet işleyen herkesin aftan yararlanacağını duyurdu.
Bu arada ABD Dışişleri Bakanı Hilary Clinton bir açıklama yaptı. ""Suriyeli muhaliflere silahlarını teslim etmeyi tavsiye etmem"" dedi. Yani Amerika Arap ülkelerinin almış olduğu kararı tanımadığını ve Suriye'ye yönelik silahlı faaliyetlerin devam etmesi için çalışacağını ilan etmiş oldu. 
Bu durumda ne olmasını beklersiniz? Arap ülkelerinin Amerika'nın bu tavrını protesto etmesini mi? Hayır, tam tersi oldu. 12 Kasım günü Arap ülkeleri Kahire'de tekrar toplandılar. Suriye'nin alınan kararlara uymadığını ve bundan dolayı Arap Birliği Örgütü'nden ihracını kararlaştırdılar. 
Tam bir komedi oynanıyor. Suyun aşağısında bulunan kurt, suyun üst başındaki kuzuya ""suyumu bulandırıyorsun, seni cezalandıracağım"" diyor. Kimse, herhangi bir şeyi gizlemeye gerek duymuyor. Amerika, AB, Türkiye ve Arap ülkeleri (Lübnan, Yemen ve Irak dışındaki) Suriye'ye ""seni yiyeceğiz"" diyorlar.
Bu arada saydığımız ülkelerden oluşan Cephe'nin ""koçbaşı"" rolünü oynayan AKP iktidarının Erdoğan, Gül ve Davutoğlu gibi sözcüleri vasıtasıyla yaptıkları açıklamaların ise ""uluslar arası haydutluk"" dışında bir tanımlamasını bulmak mümkün değil. AKP iktidarı, Suriye'deki şiddet hareketlerini açıkca destekliyor, terörist grupları barındırıyor ve resmen tanımaya hazırlanıyor. Esad sonrası senaryolar üzerine çalışıyor. Bu acele neden?
ZAYIF HALKA
Acelenin nedeni Irak'taki gelişmelerdir. Amerika bu yılın sonuna kadar Irak'tan çekilecek. Bir buçuk ay kadar bir zaman kalmış durumda. İşte büyük korkunun nedeni bu. Suriye konusunda her türlü örtüyü bir kenara atarak utanmazca ve alçakca bir saldırıya girişmelerinin de sebebi bu.
Evet, Amerika Irak'ta utanç verici bir bozgun yaşadı ve bu yılın sonunda pılını pırtısını toplayıp kaçmak zorunda kalacak. Ya sonrası?
Sonrasında El Sadr'ın en büyük siyasal güç olduğu bir Irak var. Yani İran, Sadr'ın en etkili siyasi aktör olduğu Irak ve Suriye. Birbirleriyle yakın ilişki içinde Orta Asya'dan Akdeniz'e ulaşan bir cephe oluşuyor. (Tabii bunlara Hizbullah'ın Lübnan'ını da eklemek gerekiyor)
Amerika bu tablonun ortaya çıkmasından ölesiye korkuyor. Suudi Arabistan korkuyor. Nüfusunun önemli bir kısmı Şii olan Körfez Emirlikleri korkuyor. Kısacası kaderini Amerika ile birleştirmiş olan bütün krallar, şeyhler, emirler, Batı yetiştirmesi Müslüman Kardeşler vb hepsi korkuyor.
İktidar olması Amerika sayesinde olmuş, varlığını devam ettirmesi Bölgedeki Amerika egemenliğine bağlı olan AKP açısından da, Doğusunu ve Güneyini tamamen kaplamış olan bir Anti Amerikan cephe ""ölüm"" ile aynı anlama geliyor. AKP işte bundan dolayı ""Koçbaşı"" rolünü gönüllü olarak üstlenmiş durumda.
Onun için Amerika daha gitmeden, daha iş işten tamamıyla geçmeden bir şeyler yapmak istiyorlar. Gözlerini Suriye'ye dikmiş durumdadırlar. Suriye, Batılı emperyalistler ve işbirlikçileri için ""zayıf halka"". Şimdi bütün güçleriyle ""zayıf halka""ya yükleniyorlar. Aceleleri bundan…

İKİ HAMLE
ABD açısından bütün Batı Asya'nın kaybedilmesine kadar gidecek olan bu gelişmeyi önlemek için atılması gereken birinci adım Suriye'nin düşürülmesi ise, ikinci adım da Kuzey Irak'taki Kukla devletin bağımsızlığını ilan etmesidir.
Barzani'nin son günlerde bağımsızlık için referanduma gidebileceğinden söz etmesini ve büyük petrol devlerinin birbiri peşi sıra Kuzey Irak yönetimi ile anlaşmalar imzalamasını bu çerçevede değerlendirmek gerekiyor.
Kısacası Amerika'nın düşündüğü yol haritası iyice şekillenmiş oluyor:
1. Suriye'de Esad yönetimini devirmek, işbirlikçilerini başa geçirmek.
2. Irak'ın kuzeyindeki Kukla devleti resmiyete kavuşturmak, Irak'ı 
parçalamak.
3. Etnik ve mezhep çatışmaları ile teslim alınmış Türkiye'yi, Kukla Devlet'in
Diyarbakır'a doğru genişlemesine razı etmek (Bölünerek ya da üç İsrail modeli şeklinde)
4. Elde edilen bu mevzilerden hareketle İran'a karşı harekete geçmek.

""The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,"" according to the Post. While Obama verbally set himself apart from his gung-ho predecessor, finally appointing a US ambassador to Syria in January, his administration continued to facilitate ties and secretly fund opposition groups and figures.

The US insists on enforcing the same failed policies of the past, but expects different results every time. Propping up an Iraqi opposition that took part in the destruction of Iraq (following the US invasion of 2003) seems to be the model used by US policymakers in Syria. And this too is doomed to failure.

The US is also leading the charge against Syria at the United Nations, once more trying to co-opt the Security Council to impose crippling sanctions. The prices of most basic foodstuffs are already skyrocketing and this trend is likely to continue.

""1939 Yazı"" bu savaşa giden uzun yolun son dönemini, gün gün olumlu olumsuz kahramanlarıyla 1939 yılını anlatır, insanların çaresizliğini, sürüklenişini, politikacıların ferasetsizliğini ve ihanetlerini yazar. 
İhanet kimi zaman pek tatlı, pek iç gıcıklayıcı ve fark edilmez olabilir. Savaş kapının önünde değilse, televizyon kanallarından izleniyorsa film gibi gelebilir.
Ne büyük bir yanılgı, gerçek tam da kapının önündedir. 

***
Üç büyük gerçek var bizim hayatımızda.
Her gün bombalar patlıyor, ölüm haberleri gazetelerin birinci sayfalarında. Anneler, babalar çocuklarını ölümden kurtarmak istediklerini yüksek sesle dillendiriyorlar. Parası olanlar askerlik yapmak yerine bedel ödemek istediklerini söylüyorlar. Ve bu istek kim bilir hangi hesapla siyasetin gündemindedir. Oğullarını askere yollayanlar, dağdan kurtaramayanlar büyük bir keder içinde oğullarının dönüşlerini bekliyorlar.
İkinci gerçek; Türkiye de dahil Batı'nın büyük, ama çok büyük bir ekonomik krizin içinde olduğudur. Bizim siyasetçilerimiz halkın çoğunluğunun yaşadığına değil, makro ekonominin istediği gibi yorumlanabilen rakamlarına itibar ederek ""teğet""ten söz ediyorlar. Doğru değildir. 

""Güçlü"" dünya ise kendi krizinin pekâlâ farkındadır, çare arıyor. 
""Arap Baharı"", kendi kışlarına aradıkları çarenin bugünkü adıdır.
Üçüncü gerçek; savaş istemeyen, ölmek istemeyen, komşularıyla iyi geçinmek isteyen Türkiye'nin bu ""çareye"" kurban edilmek istenmesidir. Türkiye'nin bu kadar övülmesinin, yerlere göklere koyulmamasının nedeni budur. Bir yandan pohpohlanırken bir yandan da ağır bir şantajın kucağında Türkiye. Buna ""senin de ötekilerden farkın olmayabilir, her gün yaşadığın ölümleri istediğimiz gün başka türlü yorumlayabiliriz"" şantajı da denilebilir. 

***
Bu gerçekleri değiştirmek gerekiyor. 
Peki nasıl? 
Batı'nın Irak'ın üzerine çullandığı günlerde gözü dönmüş birkaç yazıcının dışında aydınlar kararlılıkla savaşa karşı çıktılar. Türkiye biraz da ""Tanrı'nın eli""nin yardımıyla kıl payı emperyalistin oyunundan kurtuldu. O savaş çığırtkanları şimdi yine meydandalar. Yine ""büyük oyunun parçası olmaktan, bu kez kaybetmemekten"" söz ediyorlar.

ABD'nin Irak'a saldırısı sırasında kararsız kalan siyasi iktidarın bu kez heyecandan yerinde duramadığını, bir günde Libya, Mısır politikalarını değiştirebildiğini, Suriye ile kan kardeşliğinden kanlı bıçaklı düşmanlığa geçiverdiğini de hesaba katın.

The Cabinet approved during a session chaired by Prime Minister Adel Safar on Sunday the bill of the new political parties law in Syria as part of the directives of the political reform program and the efforts to enrich and revitalize political life, share responsibility and alternate the possession of power.

The bill includes the basic goals and principles regulating parties, the conditions and procedures for establishing and licensing them, legislations regarding parties' resources, funding, rights and duties.

The requisites for establishing any party are as follows:

1-Commitment to the constitution, principles of democracy and the rule of law, respecting liberties, basic rights, world declarations of human rights and the agreements approved by the Syrian Arab Republic.

2-Preserving the unity of the homeland and bolstering society's national unity.

3-Making public the principles, goals, methods and funding of a party.

4-A party cannot be based on religious, tribal, regional, denominational, or profession-related basis or on the basis of discrimination due to ethnicity, gender or race.

5-A party's formation, selection of leadership and commencement of activities must be carried out using democratic basis.

6-A party's methods must not include establishing public or covert military or paramilitary formations, nor must it use violence of any kind, threaten with it, or instigate it.

7-A party cannot be a branch of a non-Syrian party or political organization, not can it be affiliated to one.

The cabinet also announced that official work hours in ministries, administrations, establishments and other public bodies during the month of Ramadan are from 9 AM to 3 PM.

This excludes public bodies where the nature of their work requires continuing work past 3 PM, in which case the actual work hours during Ramadan are decided according to the nature of their work and the requirements of public interest.

In a statement to the press after the meeting, Minister of Information Dr. Adnan Mahmoud said that the new parties law bill lays the legislative and legal foundations for political life and party pluralism, which are the basis of the democratic system.

Dr. Mahmoud said that the law will revitalize political activity and expand proper participation in running the state by establishing a suitable environment for new parties for the purpose of alternating the possession of power and participating in the responsibilities of government.

The Minister pointed out that the law was designed to be modern and similar to parties laws around the world while taking Syria's characteristics into account, which is why no parties can be formed on religious, sectarian, tribal or regional bases, adding the tens of thousands of citizens provided suggestions and opinions through the Tasharukia website, which helped enrich the bill.

In turn, Minister of Justice Judge Tayseer Qala Awwad said that the full bill includes 40 articles, including parties' goals, principles, establishment conditions, resources, and financial, general and closing legislations.

On applying for establishing a party, the Minister said that the application should be referred to the committee with the signature of 50 of its members, adding that the members should be of Syrian nationality for more than 10 years, over 25 years old, not convicted of an offense or felony, and not a member of another Syrian or foreign party.

He indicated that the minimum number of any party members should be 1000, and that they should belong to at least half of the Syrian governorate with each governorate represented by at least 5% of the overall number of members.

The Minister pointed out that the committee will decide, within 60 days from receiving the application, whether to accept or reject the application, and that rejection will be accompanied by an explanation.

He added that in case the committee fails to decide within that period, the application will be considered accepted, and in case the application is rejected, the applicants can object within 15 days and the court will have 60 days to reach a decision.

On April 4, 2010, whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks published a classified video of a United States Apache helicopter firing on civilians in New Baghdad in 2007. The video, available at www.collateralmurder.com, shows Americans shooting and killing 11 individuals who do not return fire. Two of those killed were Reuters' employees, including 22 year old Reuters' photojournalist Namir Noor-Eldeen and his driver, 40 year old Saeed Chmagh.

The video includes an audio recording of the internal commentary by the American soldiers before, during and after the shooting. The soldiers repeatedly request and are granted permission to open fire, encourage one another and joke about the dead and dying civilians. (Full transcript available here - www.collateralmurder.com/en/transcript.html)

A total of 11 adults were killed. Two children, passengers in a van that arrived on the scene after the first bout of gunfire had ceased, were seriously injured when the Apache helicopter opened fire on their van.

In 2007, Reuters called for an investigation into the attack. In response, a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad stated: ""There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force.""

No charges have been filed against the American soldiers in the Apache helicopter who shot and killed the civilians in the video.

In late May 2010, Private First Class Bradley Manning, an intelligence analyst with the US Army in Baghdad, was arrested. On June 6, 2010, he was charged with 2 counts of violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including eight criminal offenses and four noncriminal violations of Army regulations. The full charge sheet is available at www.bradleymanning.org/3163/charge-sheet-html.

His arrest was precipitated by an alleged online chat confession to well-known hacker and journalist Adrian Lamo.

Manning is currently imprisoned in the brig at US Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, awaiting trial. If convicted, Manning faces up to 52 years in prison, dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and benefits and unspecified fines.

There is a faint pattern that runs through the history of the Arab world, from the seventies to today, a pattern that insinuates itself into the folds of thoughts that become action, the consequences of which can be seen fully today. The Copts are just one side of the coin, the very short term. We must not forget that, in Egypt, there is the Israeli Embassy, which was assaulted recently, after the Copts. Tomorrow it will be the intellectuals and then women. It is the pattern of extremism coming to power, taking over thought and society, extremism that delves into the bowels society to instill a desire for revenge and violence into the minds of the people. It is a pattern, mind you, that is not new, but that is well rooted and built up over time.

I distinctly remember that Sadat released many Islamic radicals in the seventies, thus unconsciously creating what we see today: a long and linear path, passing through Mubarak's repressions and going underground, but still alive like a flame burning in a cave that shed only a little light, but that sheds it constantly, and is, above all, safe from prying eyes.

Today the road has smoothed out and opened up. It is needless to beat around the bush and not come to this sad certainty: extremism has most of North Africa and the heart of the Middle East in its hand.

What is surprising is the blindness, the inability to look back in history and the lack of desire to learn from the past: Algeria, which should be a historical regret for the international community, had its ""Arab Spring"" in the nineties. The extremists came, slaughtered and took power without anyone batting an eye at the river of blood of hundreds of thousands of people. Algeria is a country that today is a mute and suffering, but unfortunately extremely faithful, portrait of how the Arab countries affected by the Arab Spring will be in ten years. Or perhaps less. Bowing their heads before the excessive power of the Brotherhood, the people who had hitherto kept away extremism, tomorrow will be completely and inexorably slaves to it.

I think, with great sadness, of Tunisia, where Bourguiba use much of his time in power to block the advances of the radicals. The same Tunisia that today is suffocated by the extremist impulse which assaults the TV, universities and schools to demonstrate its strength and to instill repressive fear. The abandonment of Tunisia is a crime that the international community can never atone.

BY: MARIE COLVIN From: The Australian August 08, 2011 12:00AM

THE spokesman for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which portrays itself as a moderate Islamic movement, has called for execution and hand amputations if the Mubaraks are found guilty of murder and corruption.

""If a man has stolen millions of the state's money, the penalty is that I must cut off his hand,"" said Mahmoud Ghuzlan, a professor of biochemistry at Zagazig University. ""There is no argument. These are God's words.""

The group, banned for half a century, was legalised only after the fall of former president Hosni Mubarak.

Professor Ghuzlan said the penalty of amputation, mandated under sharia law, should apply to his sons Gamal -- the younger, who was being groomed as heir -- and Alaa, a businessman.

In a scene that transfixed the nation last week, the two brothers, both charged with profiteering, stood in court as their father lay on a trolley next to them.

The senior Mubarak, charged with responsibility for the deaths of about 850 protesters killed by his security forces, periodically craned his neck forward to peer from the defendants' cage out at the court.

Professor Ghuzlan had no sympathy. Mr Mubarak should be hanged if convicted, although ""beheading by the sword"" would be more traditional, he said.

He sought to paint sharia as a merciful alternative to Egypt's current legal system, saying a thief who stole only to feed his family would not suffer amputation.

Despite his words, Muslim Brotherhood rule would evidently be harsh. Adulterers would be whipped, alcohol banned, men and women separated in university classes and pre-marital sex and same-sex relationships would be forbidden.

Scant comfort will be taken from the spokesman's assurances that the Brotherhood, which is aware of worries about Islamic extremism, would seek only one-third of parliament's 504 seats. He admitted they planned to challenge for power in future elections.

The Muslim Brotherhood's vision of Egypt will be anathema to the secular-minded Facebook generation and liberals who fought valiantly to unseat Mr Mubarak without its help.

100681426711941_101288623317888,"BBC World Service to sign funding deal with US state department


The BBC World Service is to receive a ""significant"" sum of money from the US government to help combat the blocking of TV and internet services in countries including Iran and China.

In what the BBC said is the first deal of its kind, an agreement is expected to be signed later this month that will see US state department money – understood to be a low six-figure sum – given to the World Service to invest in developing anti-jamming technology and software.

The funding is also expected to be used to educate people in countries with state censorship in how to circumnavigate the blocking of internet and TV services.

It is understood the US government has decided the reach of the World Service is such that it makes investment worthwhile.

The US government money comes as the World Service faces a 16% cut in its annual grant from the Foreign Office – a £46m reduction in its £236.7m budget over three years that will lead to about 650 job cuts. The money will be channelled through the World Service's charitable arm, the World Service Trust.

The deal, which is expected to be formally announced on International Press Freedom Day, 3 May, follows an increase in incidents of interference with World Service output across the globe, according to its controller of strategy and business, Jim Egan.

BBC Persian television, which launched in early 2009 and airs in Iran and its neighbouring countries, has experienced numerous instances of jamming. The BBC Arabic TV news service has also been jammed in recent weeks across various parts of north Africa during the recent uprisings in Egypt and Libya.

""Governments who have an interest in denying people information particularly at times of tension and upheaval are keen to do this and it is a particular problem now,"" said Egan.

Another area in which the BBC World Service is expected to use the US money is continuing its development of early warning software.

This will allow it to detect jamming sooner than it does currently where it relies on reports from users on the ground.

""Software like this helps monitor dips in traffic which act as an early warning of jamming, and it can be more effective than relying on people contacting us and telling us they cannot access the services,"" said Egan.

The BBC also expects to use state department money to help combat internet censorship by establishing proxy servers that give the impression a computer located in one country is in fact operating in another, thereby circumnavigating attempts by repressive governments to block websites.

""China has become quite expert at blocking websites and one could say it has become something of an export industry for them – a lot of countries are keen to follow suit,"" said Egan.

""We have evidence of Libya and Egypt blocking the internet and satellite signals in recent weeks.""

Egan added that the battle against jamming is likely to be an ongoing one because repressive countries are likely to develop methods to counter any anti-censorship technology that is developed.

""It is a bit of a game of cat and mouse,"" said a BBC source.

100681426711941_100731046706979,"""It's always so sad to hear about the deaths of soldiers, of anyone in this unnecessary 'war'!  When I was in Damascus in April, I heard about the death of the brother-in-law of a friend.  He was killed by armed gunmen together with his two sons and a nephew.  They were innocent victims of this 'revolution'. (He was an army officer, but out of uniform, apparently, and in his car with the children when they were killed.) And there have been many, many others since then. The people of Syria know this, but people in the Western world aren't learning about it.

No doubt the guilt has to be spread because human nature is a curious, unpredictable thing, but a violent revolution which goes against the wishes of 20 million people or more can only lead to decades long terror and bloodshed.  And the world has to pay attention; borders are not going to contain that sort of brutality and the extremist ideology which would be necessary to combust and fuel it. 

I understand the support President al-Asad has; I know he is not the leader the media portrays here.  But it seems as long as one or two 'experts' tell us he is a 'brutal dictator' and this gets picked up by an editor or two, it becomes the truth. It 'drips' into our sub-conscious.  We have seen so many Hollywood movies and comic-book style scenarios that we believe in them, believe in cookie cutter revolutions and the stereotypes presented of Arabic 'dictators'.  

I met hundreds of Syrians in the classroom in Damascus and was as impressed by them as I would be of any group of people anywhere (and as charmed)  It seems almost 'racist' to suspect that millions of Syrians who continue to support their president must be either duped or forced out of fear to do so.  Would Australians imagine the same would be possible here?  We could be duped by a 'brutal dictator'.  The images and video of the rally in Damascus on 12/10/11 remind me of the moratoriums I attended forty years ago: hundreds of thousands of people - it seems - out in the street, united by a conviction, in the case of Syria, 'evolutionary change' through political reforms already introduced by the government and president.  People I met in Damascus were at least as sophisticated as Australians I know.
I'm not Syrian, but I do share with Syrians a passion and concern for the country. That is what happens when you get to know Syria."" - Susan Dirgham / Melbourne VIC, Australia",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/handsoffsyria/photos/a.100724200040997.1471.100681426711941/100731026706981/?type=3,2011-10-28 23:55:49,7,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0

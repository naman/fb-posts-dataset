Since taking over the FCC, President Trump's Chairman, Ajit Pai, has been waging war on internet access and consumer protections on the behalf of large corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T.
Last week, Mr. Pai took action to remove price caps that are meant to protect schools, hospitals, libraries, and small businesses from being price gouged by large corporations that provide internet services.

Mr. Pai says that price caps to protect schools, hospitals, libraries, and small businesses aren't necessary in ""areas with sufficient competition.""

The problem with that is 97 percent of the schools, hospitals, libraries, and small businesses he thinks don't need price protections are only served by one or two providers. 73 percent are only served by one provider.

What this lack of choice means is that this increasingly concentrated industry is able to raise prices to whatever they want and we as consumers are left with the option of paying their exorbitant prices or going without internet. And do we as consumers get better services in return? No.

Since its inception, the Internet has been a tool of democracy. It has allowed the dissemination of ideas, and enabled entrepreneurs to build companies.

It is as American as apple pie. It will allow us to realize the ideals of the USA: that all of us are created equal—that we all have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

The United States is one of the richest countries in the world, but that reality means very little for most people because so much of that wealth is controlled by a tiny sliver of Americans. During the past 35 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth away from the middle class and the poor to the top 0.1% of the US population. This kind of inequality continues to be one of the greatest moral and economic issues of our time. It is also a huge health issue. As Pope Francis has reminded us, to follow the commandment ""thou shalt not kill"" we must ""also say ""thou shalt not"" to an economy of exclusion and inequality.

Recent research has shown that with no action by 2025, nearly 15 million Americans could be spending half of their monthly income on rent - an increase of 25 percent. How does a family survive economically if they have to spend half their income on housing?

His regime's use of chemical weapons against the men, women and children of his country, in violation of all international conventions and moral standards, makes him a war criminal.

As the most powerful nation on earth, the United States must work with the international community to bring peace and stability to Syria, where over 400,000 people have been killed and over 6 million displaced. The horror of Syria's civil war is almost unimaginable.

If there's anything we should've learned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in which the lives of thousands of brave American men and women and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians have been lost and trillions of dollars spent, it's that it's easier to get into a war than get out of one. I'm deeply concerned that these strikes could lead to the United States once again being dragged back into the quagmire of long-term military engagement in the Middle East.

We learned that the FBI is currently investigating possible collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and the Russian government to affect the outcome of the 2016 election. We learned that this investigation began in July 2016.

We learned that President Trump's claim that the Obama administration had ordered the wiretapping of Trump's phones was false. According to Comey and Rogers, there is no evidence whatsoever for this claim. It is a lie.

These are very serious revelations. But today we learned even more, that Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump presidential campaign, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire closely connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

According to the Associated Press, Manafort ""proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse."" This is the latest piece of an enormous and growing body of evidence indicating close contact at multiple levels between the Trump campaign and Russian interests. The Trump administration's preposterous claim that Manafort played only a ""limited role"" in the campaign when he was in fact the campaign's chairman only raises more suspicions about what they are trying to hide.

We must acknowledge that the existence of an ongoing FBI investigation is not itself evidence of wrongdoing. In the United States, people are innocent until proven guilty. However, the insistence of many in the Republican majority on focusing on alleged leaks from the Obama administration rather than on the actual issue at hand — Trump's relationship with Russia — should make it clear that there needs to be an independent investigation into these questions.

124955570892789_1346255738762760,"We face a very serious political problem in this country, and that problem is manifested in the post below written yesterday by Amber Phillips of The Washington Post. In her piece, Phillips criticizes me for lowering the state of our political discourse, because I accused the president of being a ""liar.""

What should a United States senator, or any citizen, do if the president is a liar? Does ignoring this reality benefit the American people? Do we make a bad situation worse by disrespecting the president of the United States? Or do we have an obligation to say that he is a liar to protect America's standing in the world and people's trust in our institutions?
I happen to strongly believe in civil political discourse. The vast majority of people in Congress who hold views different than mine are not liars. It is critical we have strong, fact-based debates on the important issues facing our country and that we respect people who come to different conclusions. In a democracy people will always have honestly held different points of view.

But how does one respond to a president who has complete disregard for reality and who makes assertions heard by billions of people around the world that have no basis in fact?

In her post, Phillips reprints five tweets that I sent out as examples of ""the sorry state of political discourse right now."" Here they are:

Tweet #1: ""President Trump cannot continue to lie, lie, lie. It diminishes the office of the president and our standing in the world.""

One of my great concerns is that there undoubtedly will be major crises facing the United States and the global community during Trump's tenure as president. If Trump lies over and over again what kind of credibility will he, or the United States, have when we need to bring countries around the world together to respond to those crises? How many people in our country and other countries will think that Trump is just lying one more time?

Tweet #2: ""Trump said 3-5 million people voted illegally and that his victory ""was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan."" Both lies.""

Trump said three to five million people voted illegally in the last election. This is a preposterous and dangerous allegation which intentionally opens the floodgates for an increase in voter suppression efforts. Amber Phillips herself previously wrote, ""There is just no evidence of voter fraud. Why launch an investigation into something that nearly everyone in U.S. politics — save one notable exception — doesn't believe warrants an investigation?""

Trump claimed that his victory ""was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan."" Anyone with access to Google could see that this is factually incorrect. George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all had bigger electoral margins of victory than Trump.

Tweet #3: ""Trump said ""it looked like a million and a half people"" at his inauguration. Not even close.""

And then there are the trivial lies. Trump stated ""it looked like a million and a half people"" at his inauguration. Who cares? But none of the people who are trained to estimate crowd size believe that one and a half million people attended his inauguration.

Tweet #4: ""And Trump was lying long before he was president when he tried to delegitimize our first black president with the ""birther"" conspiracy.""

More importantly, Trump helped lead a baseless and dangerous attack against the legitimacy of Barack Obama's presidency by suggesting over and over again that Obama was not born in the United States and therefore not eligible to become president. This was not a disagreement with Obama over policy. It was a deliberate and dishonest effort to appeal to racist sentiment in this country and deny the right of our first African-American president to serve.

Tweet #5: ""The United States will not be respected or taken seriously around the world if @realDonaldTrump continues to shamelessly lie.""
Lastly, my tweet which states that the United States will not be respected or taken seriously around the world if Trump continues to shamelessly lie is self-evident. We are the wealthiest, most powerful nation on earth. If we have a president who is not taken seriously by people throughout the world because of his continuous lies, our international standing will clearly suffer.

I find it interesting that Ms. Phillips did not take issue with my facts. Her complaint appears to be that it is improper for a United States senator to state the obvious. And that is that we have a president who either lies intentionally or, even more frighteningly, does not know the difference between lies and truth.

What do you think?

It is easy to know how we respond to a president with whom we disagree on many, many issues. I disagree with Trump's support for repealing the Affordable Care Act. I disagree with Trump's plan to give huge tax breaks to billionaires. I disagree with Trump's appointment of an anti-environmental EPA administrator. I disagree with Trump's appointments of major Wall Street executives to key economic positions and his plans to loosen regulations on Wall Street designed to protect consumers. And on and on and on! These strong policy disagreements are a normal part of the political process. He has his views. I have mine.

But how do we deal with a president who makes statements that reverberate around our country and the world that are not based on fact or evidence? What is the appropriate way to respond to that? And if the media and political leaders fail to call lies what they are, are they then guilty of misleading the public?

What are your views on this extremely important issue? I look forward to your comments.","Analysis | The sorry state of political discourse right now, in five Bernie Sanders tweets",link,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/06/the-sorry-state-of-political-discourse-right-now-in-five-bernie-sanders-tweets/?utm_term=.06df2599f408,2017-03-08 15:02:31,14598,2560,2935,12375,1550,79,18,405,171

The arrangements had been agreed to several weeks before and hundreds of people in the area had signed up to attend the meeting that was going to be broadcast on Chris's show.

The reason I want to do a town meeting in McDowell County is pretty simple. I want to focus attention on poverty in America, something which is almost never talked about now. I want the nation to understand that in the richest country in the history of the world, 43 million Americans are living in poverty. I want people to know that, according to a 2011 American Journal of Public Health study, 130,000 people die every year in our country due to poverty.

I want people to see, first hand, how poverty leads to terrible despair and that, in reality, how it is a death sentence for many. In McDowell County, one of the poorest areas in one of our poorest states, people are now living shorter lives than their parents. Unemployment is sky high, drug addiction is at an epidemic rate and the schools lack adequate funding. It is high time that we, as a nation, heard from the people who are impacted by this crisis and determined the best ways forward.

In a year full of distressing stories — especially about race, crime and violence in urban neighborhoods — this one points to some hope. Earlier this December, we covered a summer jobs program in Chicago that appeared to lead to fewer teenage arrests for violent crime. Our original story, republished below, also reminds us that policy solutions are possible — and possibly even inexpensive.

A couple of years ago, the city of Chicago started a summer jobs programfor teenagers attending high schools in some of the city's high-crime, low-income neighborhoods. The program was meant, of course, to connect students to work. But officials also hoped that it might curb the kinds of problems — like higher crime — that arise when there's no work to be found.

Research on the program conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and just published in the journal Science suggests that these summer jobs have actually had such an effect: Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program had 43 percent fewer violent-crime arrests over 16 months, compared to students in a control group.

That number is striking for a couple of reasons: It implies that a relatively short (and inexpensive) intervention like an eight-week summer jobs program can have a lasting effect on teenage behavior. And it lends empirical support to a popular refrain by advocates: ""Nothing stops a bullet like a job.""

124955570892789_752086444846362,"An Economic Agenda for America: 12 Steps Forward - Sen. Bernie Sanders, The Huffington Post: 

The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.

The long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008, has not been pretty. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth. We have one of the highest childhood poverty rates and we are the only country in the industrialized world which does not guarantee health care for all. We once led the world in terms of the percentage of our people who graduated college, but we are now in 12th place. Our infrastructure, once the envy of the world, is collapsing.

This week I introduced legislation to make Election Day a national holiday -- Democracy Day.

I am doing this because, as a nation, we should be embarrassed by the abysmally low voter turnout that we experienced in last week's midterm elections. 

In 1863 at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln described our democratic form of government as one ""of the people, by the people and for the people."" And where are we today? Are we ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" when 60 percent of those people didn't vote and 80 percent of young and low-income people failed to vote? Are we a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people"" when poll after poll shows that most Americans can't even name the political parties that control the U.S. Senate and U.S. House or who their members of Congress are? Are we a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people"" when billionaires can spend unlimited amounts of money to elect candidates to represent their interests?

As a member of the U.S. Senate I can assure you that if Republicans win this week and take complete control of the U.S. Congress, it would be disastrous for the American people — in so many ways.

The Republican Party, under the influence of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families, continues to call for major cuts in programs desperately needed by working families. Unbelievably, in this very tough economy, many Republicans want cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition and environmental programs. They are vigorously opposed to any increase in the minimum wage or a major jobs program that would put the unemployed back to work.

124955570892789_725492874172386,"Bernie Sanders vs. the Billionaires - Andrew Prokop, Vox: 

On a recent Sunday morning in Waterloo, Iowa, about 150 people filed into the local arts center to hear a speech by the United States' only socialist senator. Vermont's Bernie Sanders, white-haired and 73 years old, spoke for about an hour in his gravel-voiced, thick Brooklyn accent. His views are, he said, ""a little different than most views."" Sanders denounced the power of the wealthy, advocated for single-payer health care and the public funding of elections — and called for a ""political revolution"" in America.

The crowd of mostly-elderly, liberal Iowans seemed to like the senator's pitch. When Sanders said the top 25 hedge fund managers last year made more money than 425,000 public school teachers, many gasped. When he said Wall Street bankers were ""too big to jail,"" many clapped. And when he opened the floor for questions, one from a younger audience member, Rachel Antonuccio, led to particularly loud cheers. ""I have a very simple question,"" she said to Sanders. ""Will you please run for president?""
Once Sanders quieted the applause, he didn't give the standard politician's coy non-response. He admitted that he's ""given thought to"" running, saying he was motivated by the ""enormous problems"" the US faces — but he then quickly veered into his misgivings.
-
""I'm not much into hero-worship and all this stuff,"" he said. ""If somebody like me — or me — became president, there is no chance in the world that anything significant could be accomplished without the active, unprecedented support of millions of people, who would be prepared to make a commitment — the likes of which we have not made!""

 Heading into the final month ahead of the 2014 midterm election, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders exhorted fellow progressives to plug away at the unglamorous nuts-and-bolts of the campaign against a ""billionaire class whose greed knows no bounds.""

""Everyone in this room understands participating in the political process is the most patriotic thing we can do,"" Sanders, the U.S. Senate's longest-serving independent, told about 400 people Sunday at the Johnson County Democratic barbecue.

The polls and prognosticators may paint a bleak picture for the party in the Nov. 4 election, he said, ""but if we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish for our great country.""

We are at a pivotal moment in American history.

Building the United States of America has been long, arduous and rife with setbacks. But throughout the years, we have undoubtedly moved forward toward a more inclusive democracy. We expanded the right to vote. We eliminated the poll tax. We banned corporations from donating to campaigns after the scandals of the Gilded Age and imposed stricter limits on donations and expenditures after Watergate.

But today, those improvements are in serious jeopardy. The Supreme Court struck down a major part of the Voting Rights Act and Congress has yet to pass a fix. Voter ID laws are the new poll taxes.

As members of Congress continue hammering out a bill to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs' beleaguered health care system, attention has focused on one man leading the charge: Bernie Sanders, Independent senator from Vermont and a self-described socialist.

Sanders barely got 2 percent of the vote when he first tried breaking into Vermont politics in the 1970s, but now there's buzz that the man known simply as ""Bernie"" may be a presidential candidate in 2016.

""The cost of war is huge,"" he said recently during lunch at Henry's Diner in Burlington, Vt., where he rose to become an immensely popular mayor in the 1980s. ""It's not just tanks and guns and planes. It's what happens to people's lives.""

Sanders' frizzy hair may have gotten whiter since his mayoral days, but it could still use a comb. And when he opens his mouth, you don't hear New England — you hear Brooklyn.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.""

Today, while the very rich become richer, the poor become poorer and the middle class disappears, the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%, and 95% of all new income goes to the top 1%.

WASHINGTON -- Kent Conrad's phone hasn't been ringing very much over the past few weeks, as Iraq, and the debate over America's future in the country, has once again dominated the news.

The architects of the Iraq war are back in TV studios and on op-ed pages, as are journalists and pundits who promoted the Bush administration's ultimately bogus case for invading. But Conrad, a former senator who was one of only 23 to vote against authorizing the war in October 2002, hasn't heard from CNN, MSNBC or any other TV outlet. ""Not once,"" he said, when asked if anyone in the press had reached out regarding the current crisis in Iraq.

In an email to The Huffington Post, Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, offered two possible explanations. The first, he said, is ""simply the incompetence of the media."" The second is ""the shrillness of those trying desperately to rewrite history to cover their own devastating failures.""

124955570892789_673456926042648,"Protect Net Neutrality: 

At a time of increased corporate control over the media and the flow of information, it is absolutely imperative that the Internet remain on a level playing field, open to all.

Whether you are a major news corporation or a one-person blogging operation, whether you are Walmart or a family-owned small business, there should be net neutrality for all.

Right now the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering a rule that would allow large Internet providers like Verizon and Comcast to charge businesses for faster access to Internet users. This rule would give large corporations yet another advantage over small Internet companies and average citizens. These types of pay-to-play agreements will end the democratic foundation of the Internet, and strike a major blow against the free flow of ideas.

Join me and my colleague Senator Al Franken in protecting net neutrality so that big telecom can't pick winners and losers online. 

Our free and open Internet has made invaluable contributions to democracy here in the United States and around the world. We must not allow the FCC to let big corporations to turn a profit by putting a fee on the free flow of ideas.

Please, join me to protect net neutrality. Add your name today!

124955570892789_667548816633459,"CEO Pay Has Increased By 937 Percent Since 1978 - Rebecca Hiscott, The Huffington Post:

A new report by the Economic Policy Institute shows that CEO compensation at the largest corporations has ballooned by 937 percent since 1978, when adjusted for inflation. A typical worker's compensation grew a measly 10.2 percent over the same period.

The average CEO compensation at the 350 publicly owned companies with the largest annual revenue in the U.S. last year was $15.2 million, according to the EPI, a left-leaning think tank. That's a 21.7 percent rise since just 2010.

These massive increases are fattening CEOs' wallets while those of average Americans look ever leaner. Of all income groups, it's arguably minimum-wage earners who have suffered the most. The federal minimum wage has declined sharply since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation. If it had kept pace with increases in workplace productivity, the federal minimum wage would be $21.72 an hour -- triple what it is today.

Meanwhile, median CEO pay among large public companies broke eight figures for the first time last year, according to a recent Associated Press/Equilar study.

In 2013, according to the EPI's study, the average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was nearly 296-to-1. That's down from a high of 383-to-1 in the boom years of the 2000s, but up from 193-to-1 in the depths of the recession.

124955570892789_656970701024604,"Why Democrats Need Bernie Sanders to Run for President - Michael Kazin, The New Republic: 

Bernie Sanders may actually run for president. The feisty Senator from Vermont is giving dinner speeches in Iowa, telling journalists he's ""prepared"" to campaign, and is deciding whether he wants to compete for the Democratic nomination or take the ""radical"" step of heading an independent ticket. Assuming he rejects the Naderish option, which would upset many of his admirers who recall the 2000 debacle, a Sanders run could be excellent news for Democrats—in the next presidential race and beyond.

At a minimum, it would make the Democratic primary about more than the deeds and personality of Hillary the inevitable. Sanders, as eloquent a voice of left-wing populism as exists in the land, would press Clinton to support doubling the current minimum wage, imposing higher taxes on the wealthy, and increasing entitlement payments instead of reducing them in a ""grand bargain"" with Republicans. He would also push her to explain how she would end the dominion of big money in politics, long one of his signature issues. Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case.  According to multiple polls, these are all popular positions—among independents as well as Democrats. But without a shove from the left, Clinton is likely to stick to a mushy moderation, hoping a lengthy battle inside the GOP will result in a nominee too right-wing for the majority of the electorate to stomach.

NORTHAMPTON — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders does not believe his support for the working class makes him unusual.

Though he finds that many people who call themselves progressives believe they are in the minority, he does not believe this about himself, he said.

""Every idea I ever espoused, I believe, is what the vast majority of our country believe,"" Sanders told a crowd of around 400 people who filled the sanctuary at First Churches Friday for ""A Conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders,"" an event sponsored by The Nation magazine, Progressive Democrats of America, and radio station WHMP.

""The Koch brothers and their friends are a small minority. Never, ever forget that,"" Sanders said.

The independent senator was invited to Northampton by Tim Carpenter, founder of the Progressive Democrats of America, to speak as part of the national organization's 10th anniversary celebration. Carpenter, of Florence, died April 28 at the age of 55.

In McCutcheon, just like in Citizens United, the Roberts majority of the Supreme Court essentially legalized corruption, first by corporations and now by super-wealthy individual donors.

When Russ Feingold joined with John McCain and passed campaign-finance reform, they did it because huge, unlimited checks were corrupting our government. Unfortunately, today's conservative court, in 5-4 votes, embraces corruption.

The more corporate money is allowed to corrupt our government, the more elected officials are beholden to the rich and the powerful, the harder it becomes to win fights for working Americans. Corruption affects everything. Corruption makes it harder to pass an increase in the minimum wage, to expand Social Security benefits, to reverse climate change and to block the horrible trade deals that send jobs overseas. Corruption means letting Wall Street run wild.

Stand with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Progressives United and tell the Supreme Court that we cannot allow the billionaire class to buy our elections!

124955570892789_646643318724009,"Bernie Sanders for president? -  It's the longest of long shots, but that doesn't mean he won't do it. - Jaime Fuller, Washington Post: 

If Hillary Rodham Clinton or Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz admitted they were seriously considering starting a presidential campaign, it's hard to overstate how much of a media response that would provoke. When Bernie Sanders announces that he's been thinking about 2016, the same hysteria doesn't hold.

The senator from Vermont  isn't surprised. Although reporters have always been enamored of his hair -- which starts to resemble Charlton Heston parting a sea when Sanders begins passionately speaking about income inequality or Social Security -- and his gruff unwillingness to tell anecdotes lest you write about his personality rather than his policies, his political ambitions are rarely taken seriously.

With presidential candidates now relying on raising millions from small donors and big donors — besides having one, two or three outside groups raising millions on the side — a candidate who has made fighting big donors and outside groups part of his platform seems to have pre-written his campaign's death knell. Sanders has never accepted corporate PAC money, and the average donation to his campaign during the first quarter of 2014 was $28.95.

124955570892789_642012462520428,"The Richer You Are the Older You'll Get - Josh Zumbrun, The Wall Street Journal: 

Money may not buy love, but it appears to buy years.

Economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers and found that the richer you are, the longer you'll live. And it's a gap that is widening, particularly among women.

Mr. Bosworth parsed this data from the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a survey that tracks the health and work-life of 26,000 Americans as they age and retire. The data is especially valuable as it tracks the same individuals every two years in what's known as a longitudinal study, to see how their lives unfold.

The good news is that men of all incomes are living longer. Yet the data shows that the life expectancy of the wealthy is growing much faster than the life expectancy of the poor.

Here's the sort of detail this remarkable data set can show. You can look at a man born in 1940 and see that during the 1980s, the mid-point of his career, his income was in the top 10% for his age group. If that man lives to age 55 he can expect to live an additional 34.9 years, or to the age of 89.9. That's six years longer than a man whose career followed the same arc, but who was born in 1920.

124955570892789_640826042639070,"Who Are the Koch Brothers and What Do They Want? - Sen. Sanders, The Huffington Post:

As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process. The results of that decision are clear. In the coming months and years the Koch brothers and other extraordinarily wealthy families will spend billions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates to the Senate, the House, governors' mansions and the presidency of the United States. These billionaires already own much of our economy. That, apparently, is not enough. Now, they want to own the United States government as well.

Four years ago, the Supreme Court handed down the 5-4 ruling in Citizens United vs the Federal Election Commission. A few weeks ago, they announced another horrendous campaign finance decision in McCutcheon vs. FEC giving even more political power to the rich. Now, many Republicans want to push this Supreme Court to go even further. In the name of ""free speech,"" they want the Court to eliminate all restrictions on campaign spending -- a position that Justice Thomas supported in McCutcheon -- and a view supported by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Importantly, as a means of being able to exercise unprecedented power over the political process, this has been the position of the Koch brothers for at least the last 34 years.

The Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in America, making most of their money in the fossil fuel industry. According to Forbes Magazine, they saw their wealth increase last year from $68 billion to $80 billion. In other words, under the ""anti-business"", ""socialist"" and ""oppressive"" Obama administration, their wealth went up by $12 billion in one year.

As the 2014 election season gets underway, the Supreme Court has struck down a long-standing limit on how much donors can give to federal candidates, political parties and political action committees in a two-year election cycle. Without any aggregate limit, a donor can now give millions directly to candidates and parties. The 5-to-4 decision in the McCutcheon v. FEC case is being described as the ""next Citizens United,"" referring to the 2010 ruling that opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate spending on U.S. elections. We speak to Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont about Wednesday's landmark decision and his fight to remove big money from the electoral process. We also discuss Sanders' potential presidential run in 2016, which he says he is considering ""not because I wake up in the morning with a burning desire to be president … but [because] I happen to believe there are such enormous issues out there that I just don't want to see swept under the rug.""

A massive coalition representing millions of Americans came together including senior groups, unions, veterans' organizations, women's groups, civil rights groups, disability organizations and others. Petitions were signed, calls to Congress were made, emails were sent and demonstrations and rallies were held. In essence, grass-roots America made an offer that members of Congress could not afford to refuse. We told them we knew what was going on and there would be a political price to pay if they ignored us. And they didn't.""

Click below to give Bernie your thoughts.  Should government address the issue?  What are the best ways forward?

In a recent statement, Bernie said:

""In America today, the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of our country's financial wealth. The bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. The increasing wealth inequality in the United States has become the great moral issue of our time.

In America today, one family, the Walton family of Wal-Mart, owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent, and the top 400 individuals have more wealth than the bottom half of our country -- over 150 million people.

In terms of income, the top 1 percent earns more than the bottom 50 percent, while the wealthiest 16,000 Americans, who make more than $10 million a year (the top 0.01 percent), saw their income increase by nearly a third between 2011 and 2012.

According to a recent study, from 2009 to 2012, 95 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, since 1999, median family income declined by more than $5,000 after adjusting for inflation.

Today, a record-breaking 46.5 million people live in poverty in the United States. At 21.8 percent, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. One out of four of our kids now lives in a family that receives food stamps.

Poverty among seniors is growing. Over 9 percent of seniors lived in poverty in 2012, higher than in 2009. More American seniors were living in poverty last year than in 1972.

In recent years, while median family income has declined and poverty has increased, the number of millionaires and billionaires has grown at an extraordinary rate. In 1996, there were 121 billionaires in America. Today, there are 442.""",Is Wealth and Income Inequality the Moral Issue of Our Time?,link,https://services.myngp.com/ngponlineservices/petition.aspx?X=Ja5OPsDYzMY%3D,2013-11-18 12:27:19,1447,358,261,1447,0,0,0,0,0

""The Republicans must stop holding the American people hostage.  Speaker Boehner must allow the House to vote so that they reopen the government and pay our bills. Frankly, given the enormous problems facing this country, it is beyond belief that we have wasted weeks debating whether, for the first time in our history, the largest economy in the world should default and plunge the world into a severe financial crisis.

""Yesterday, the Republicans were using the Affordable Care Act as the reason why they had to shut down the government and not pay our bills. Today, it's 'reforming' Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. What will it be tomorrow?

""Social Security, which is independently funded through the payroll tax, has nothing to do with the deficit.  The deficit -- which has been cut in half since 2009 -- was significantly caused by the Bush wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and the Wall Street-induced recession, which led to a significant decline in federal revenue.

""The Republican Party and Paul Ryan cannot be allowed to get their way by threatening the American people with a continued government shutdown and a default unless Congress cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  That is not what the American people want.  Rather, we should be passing legislation which rebuilds our infrastructure and creates millions of new jobs, address the crisis of low wage employment by raising the minimum wage, make college affordable and fight for equal pay for equal work.""",Sen.

It is widely believed that there now exists in the House a majority of members (virtually all Democrats and some moderate Republicans) who are prepared to vote for a clean continuing budget resolution which would immediately re-open the government.  House Speaker Boehner must allow the House to have that vote.

""It is also important that people understand that the real issue here is not just the desire of Republicans to defund Obamacare. At a time when the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing, these right-wing ideologues want to repeal virtually every piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years which protects the elderly, the children, the sick, the poor and the environment.  The truth is that ending Obamacare is just a small part of the right-wing extremist agenda, which is heavily funded by the Koch brothers and other very wealthy and powerful special interests.

""The Senate just last month went on record in opposition to the president's approach. In poll after poll, the American people are overwhelmingly against cutting Social Security. And organizations representing a broad spectrum of millions of Americans from the AFL-CIO to the American Legion to AARP to NOW have urged the president not to make this terrible mistake.

""This is not a minor tweak, as its proponents contend. Under Obama's proposal, according to the Social Security Administration, 65-year-old retirees would lose more than $650 a year by their 75th birthday, and more than $1,000 a year would be cut from their benefits once they reach 85. The proposed change would also affect more than 3.2 million disabled veterans receiving disability compensation benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans who started receiving V.A. disability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits reduced by $1,425 a year at age 45, $2,341 at age 55 and $3,231 at age 65. Benefits for more than 350,000 surviving spouses and children would also be cut.

""I remember when Obama said he was concerned about retirees struggling to get by and was unequivocal in his opposition to cutting cost-of-living adjustments. On September 6, 2008, then Sen. Obama spoke to the AARP 50th anniversary convention. 'John McCain's campaign has gone even further suggesting that the best answer for the growing pressure on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear. I will not do either.'

""I also hope the president follows up on another suggestion that he made during that campaign and gets behind my legislation to raise the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, extending the life of Social Security for generations to come without the need to cut benefits or raise taxes on the middle class.

""Last week, Sanders announced plans to introduce an interesting new bill, one that's a direct response to comments made recently by the likes of Eric Holder about the difficulty in prosecuting big banks. Holder said some institutions have grown so large that prosecuting its executives may have a ""negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.""

""...What the Sanders bill would do is force Holder and the White House to actually spell out the policy. It would give Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 90 days to compile a list of all the financial institutions that they think are too big to prosecute. The list would include ""any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance.""

""But this isn't an isolated thing. Bernie's bill comes on the heels of a series of developments that, to me anyway, signal a shift in thinking on this issue on the Hill.""

2. That benefits earned by disabled veterans as a result of losing their arms, legs or eyesight in Iraq and Afghanistan are too generous. Disabled veterans' benefits should be cut over the next 15 years by more than $1,400 a year.

Below is Bernie's statement on why he voted NO.

January 24, 2013
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

""This country faces major crises in terms of the economy and unemployment, the deficit, global warming, health care, campaign finance reform, education and a crumbling infrastructure – to name a few.  In my view, none of these problems will be effectively addressed so long as one senator can demand 60 votes to pass legislation. The rule changes adopted today are a step forward in making the operations of the Senate more efficient and expeditious.  They are not enough.

""Most Americans grew up believing that in America the majority rules.  That is not the case in the Senate. For many years now, especially since President Obama has been in office, it has taken 60 votes to pass any significant piece of legislation. When Lyndon Johnson was majority leader in the 1950s, he filed cloture to end a filibuster only once.  Majority Leader Reid has filed cloture 390 times.

""The Senate is not the House and the minority party must be treated with respect and given the opportunity to offer amendments and make their case in opposition.  A minority must not, however, be allowed to permanently obstruct the wishes of the majority.  That is not democracy.  That is a perversion of democracy.

""In my view, if a senator or a group of senators are strenuously opposed to legislation they have the right and duty to come to the floor and, for as long as they want, engage in a talking filibuster by explaining to the American people the reasons for their objection.  They should not, however, continue to have the right to abuse arcane Senate rules to block a majority of senators from acting on behalf of the American people.""",,status,,2013-01-28 14:32:54,567,89,151,567,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you so much for standing with me, and thank you for demanding that Congress start representing all of the people and not just billionaire campaign contributors.

Yesterday was a great day, and I suspect that the right-wing extremists of this country did not wake up this morning feeling very well.  Against the efforts of dozens of billionaires, the President was re-elected and some great Progressives were elected and re-elected to the Senate.

The election is over, but this country continues to face enormous problems.  In my view, these problems will not be satisfactorily addressed unless we build a strong and energetic grass-roots movement.  You are part of that movement.  You can continue to make an enormous difference.

I look forward to continue working with you in the months and years ahead.

Further, our staff and volunteers have knocked on over 15,000 doors as we have door-to-door discussions about the issues facing working families and the direction we need to go to protect the middle class.

I believe that what we're doing in Vermont can be a model for the country in terms of progressive grass-roots politics.

Please enjoy the video clip below of a campaign meeting we held this past Friday in Putney, Vermont -- where over 250 people came out.  This is what we're doing in Vermont.  This is what we need to do all over this country.

""The simple truth is that today's Republican Party wants to undo virtually every piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years that was designed to provide dignity and security to ordinary Americans. It's not just that many of them want to destroy Social Security; it's that some leading Republicans are so opposed to government serving the needs of working families that they actually believe that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the minimum wage are 'unconstitutional.'

In short, the Republican Party of today wants to move this country into an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of very wealthy people control the economic and political life of the nation.

WE MUST NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN!""",News Update: Fighting Back | Friends of Bernie Sanders,link,http://www.bernie.org/news/news-update-fighting-back/,2012-09-17 10:37:07,458,31,204,458,0,0,0,0,0

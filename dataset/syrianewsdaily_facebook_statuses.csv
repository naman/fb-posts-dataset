US president Donald Trump is not a truly independent political leader but merely a puppet of US corporations, military and intelligence, and who serves their interests, Syrian President Bashar Assad has told the Latin American #TeleSUR TV network.

Trump pursues ""no own policies"" but only executes the decisions made by the ""intelligence agencies, the Pentagon, the big arms manufacturers, oil companies, and financial institutions,"" the Syrian leader said in an exclusive interview with TeleSUR.

""As we have seen in the past few weeks, he changed his rhetoric completely and subjected himself to the terms of the deep American state, or the deep American regime,"" Assad added.

He referred to the fact that Trump came to power on a political platform promising a departure from the interventionist policy of the previous US president, Barack Obama, but soon forgot his promises and ordered a missile strike against the Syrian air base following a chemical weapons incident in Syria's Idlib province.

The Syrian president also said that it is ""a complete waste of time to make an assessment of the American president's foreign policy"" as ""he might say something"" but what he really does depends on ""what these [US military and business] institutions dictate to him.""

He also added that it ""is not new"" and ""has been ongoing American policy for decades.""

""This is what characterizes American politicians: they lie on a daily basis... That's why we shouldn't believe what the Pentagon or any other American institution says because they say things which serve their policies, not things which reflect reality and the facts on the ground,"" Assad told TeleSUR.

He went on to say that the US continues to pursue its age-long policy aimed at establishing and maintaining a global hegemony by turning all countries that oppose it into war zones.

""The United States always seeks to control all the states of the world without exception. It does not accept allies, regardless of whether they are developed states as those in the Western bloc or other states of the world,"" the Syrian leader explained.

He also added that ""what is happening to Syria, to Korea, to Iran, to Russia, and maybe to Venezuela now, aims at re-imposing American hegemony on the world because they believe that this hegemony is under threat now, which consequently threatens the interests of American economic and political elites.""

Assad expressed similar views in an interview with Russia's Sputnik news agency about a week ago. ""The regime in the United States hasn't changed,"" he said, adding, ""since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has been attacking different countries in different ways without taking into consideration the Security Council or the United Nations.""

He also said that for the US, ""the end justifies the means, no values, no morals at all, anything could happen.""

Despite his criticism, Assad once again confirmed the readiness of the Syrian government to cooperate with the US if it could change its attitude towards respecting other countries' sovereignty and that of Syria in particular.

195107810685628_622627291267009,"Syria's President #Assad to #AFP :

""...no-one has investigated what happened that day in Khan Sheikhoun till the moment. As you know, Khan Sheikhoun is under the control of al-Nusra Front, which is a branch of Al Qaeda, so the only information the world have had till this moment is published by Al Qaeda branch. No-one has any other information. We don't know if the whole pictures or videos that we've been seeing are true or fabricated. That's why we asked for investigation to what happened in Khan Sheikhoun. 

...Al Qaeda sources said that the attack happened at 6, 6:30 in the morning, while the Syrian attack in the same area was around noon, between 11:30 to 12. So, they're talking about two different stories or events. So, there was no order to make any attack, we don't have any chemical weapons, we gave up our arsenal a few years ago. Even if we have them, we wouldn't use them, and we have never used our chemical arsenal in our history.

...it's only few days – two days, 48 hours – between the play and the attacks, and no investigations, no concrete evidence about anything, the only thing were allegations and propaganda, and then strike. 
The allegation itself was by Al Qaeda, al-Nusra Front, so we don't have to investigate who, they announced it, it's under their control, no-one else. About the attack, as I said, it's not clear whether it happened or not, because how can you verify a video? You have a lot of fake videos now, and you have the proof that those videos were fake, like the White Helmets for example, they are Al Qaeda, they are al-Nusra Front who shaved their beards, wore white hats, and appeared as humanitarian heroes, which is not the case. The same people were killing Syrian soldiers, and you have the proof on the internet anyway. So, the same thing for that chemical attack, we don't know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun? Were they dead at all? Who committed the attack if there was an attack? What's the material? You have no information at all, nothing at all, no-one investigated. 

...a hundred percent for us, it's fabrication. We don't have an arsenal, we're not going to use it. And you have many indications if you don't have proof, because no-one has concrete information or evidences, but you have indications. For example, less than two weeks, around ten days before that attack, the terrorists were advancing in many fronts, including the suburbs of Damascus and Hama which is not far from Khan Sheikhoun, let's suppose we have this arsenal, and let's suppose that we have the will to use it, why didn't we use it when we were retreating and the terrorists were advancing? Actually, the timing of that attack or alleged attack was when the Syrian Army was advancing very fast, and actually the terrorists were collapsing. So, why to use it, if you have it and if you have the will, why to use it at that timing, not when you were in a difficult situation, logically? This is first.

Second, if you want to use it, if you have it and if you want to use it – again, this is if we suppose – why to use it against civilians, not to use it against the terrorists that we are fighting? Third, in that area, we don't have army, we don't have battles, we don't have any, let's say, object in Khan Sheikhoun, and it's not a strategic area. Why to attack it? What's the reason? Militarily, I'm talking from a military point of view. Of course, the foundation for us, morally, we wouldn't do it if we have it, we wouldn't have the will, because morally this is not acceptable. We won't have the support of the public. So, every indication is against the whole story, so you can say that this play that they staged doesn't hold together. The story is not convincing by any means.

...If they are serious in fighting terrorists, we're going to be partners, and I said not only the United States; whoever wants to fight the terrorists, we are partners. This is basic for us, basic principle, let's say. Actually, what has been proven recently, as I said earlier, that they are hand in glove with those terrorists, the United States and the West, they're not serious in fighting the terrorists, and yesterday some of their statesmen were defending ISIS. They were saying that ISIS doesn't have chemical weapons. They are defending ISIS against the Syrian government and the Syrian Army. So, actually, you cannot talk about partnership between us who work against the terrorists and who fight the terrorism and the others who are supporting explicitly the terrorists.

... it's not about the President in the United State; it's about the regime and the deep state or the deep regime in the United States is still the same, it doesn't change. The President is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every President there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he's going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree U-turn, otherwise he would pay the price politically.""

Question 7: But do you think that there will be another attack?

President Assad: ""As long as the United States is being governed by this complex of military industrial complex, the financial companies, banks, and what you call deep regime, and works for the vested interest of those groups, of course. It could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria.

... if you want to talk about retaliation, we are talking about missiles coming from hundreds of miles, which is out of our reach, but actually the real war in Syria is not about those missiles; it's about supporting the terrorists. This is the most dangerous part of this war, and our response is going to be what we started from the very first day: is smashing the terrorists everywhere in Syria. When we get rid of the terrorists, we wouldn't worry about anything else at that time."" 

Question 10: Would you accept the findings of OPCW investigation?

President Assad: ""Since the very first time, when we had in 2013, I think, the first attacks by the terrorists on the Syrian Army by chemical missiles at that time, we asked for investigation. We were the ones who asked for investigations every time there was chemical attacks or allegations about chemical attacks. We asked. And this time, we were discussing with the Russians yesterday and during the last few days after the strike that we're going to work with them on international investigation. But it should be impartial. We can only allow any investigation when it's impartial, when we make sure that unbiased countries will participate in this delegation in order to make sure that they won't use it for politicized purposes.

...if they can prove that there's an attack, we have to investigate who gave the order to that attack. But a hundred percent, as Syrian Army, we don't have, and we cannot – even if we want, we cannot – we don't have the means to commit such attack, and we don't have the will.

Question 12: So, you mean that you don't have chemical weapons?

President Assad: ""No, no, definitely, a few years ago, in 2013, we gave up all our arsenal, and the chemical agency announced that Syria is free of any chemical materials.""

Question 13: Because the Pentagon said that there are chemical weapons in the airbase, you deny it?

President Assad: ""They attacked that airbase, and they destroyed the depots of different materials, and there was no sarin gas. How? If they said that we launched the sarin attack from that airbase, what happened to the sarin when they attacked the depots? Did we hear about any sarin? Our Chief of Staff was there a few hours later, how could he go there if there was sarin gas? How could you only have six martyrs if you have hundreds of soldiers and officers working there, but there was sarin, and they didn't die. The same fabricated videos that we've been seeing about Khan Sheikhoun, when the rescuers tried to rescue the victims or the supposedly dead people or inflicted people, but actually they weren't wearing any masks or any gloves. How? Where's the sarin? They should be affected, right away. So, this is all allegation. I mean, this attack and these allegations is another proof that it was fabricated and there was no sarin anywhere.

Even if you have a rogue element, the army doesn't have chemical materials. This is first. Second, a rogue army cannot send an airplane at their will, even if they want. It's an airplane, it's not a small car to take it from place to place or a small machinegun to use it. You can talk about somebody who has been using his pistol on his behalf the way he wants and break the law, that could happen anywhere in the world, but not an airplane. This is second.

Third, the Syrian Army is a regular army, it's not a militia. It's a regular army, it has hierarchy, it has very clear way of orders, so this kind of ""rough personnel tried to do something against the will of the leadership of the army"" never happened during the last six years of the war in Syria.

...what we and the Russians announced about a few airplanes being destroyed, most of them are the old ones, some of them were not active anyway. This is the reality, and the proof is that, since the strike, we haven't stopped attacking terrorists all over Syria. So, we didn't feel that we are really affected. Our firepower, our ability to attack the terrorists hasn't been affected by this strike.

...when you attack any target related to the terrorists, you don't know what's in it. You know that this a target; it could be a store, it could be warehouse, it could be a depot, it could be a camp, it could be a headquarter, we don't know. But you know that the terrorists are using this place and you attack it, like any other place, and that's what we've been doing since the beginning of the war on daily bases, on hourly bases sometimes, but you cannot tell what's within this. So, that was one of the possibilities that the airstrikes attacked a depot of chemical materials, but this is conflicting again with the timing of the announcement, not because only the terrorists announced it in the morning, but because their media, their pages on Twitter and on the internet announced the attack a few hours before the alleged one, which is 4 in the morning. 4 in the morning, they announced that there's going to be a chemical attack, we have to be ready. How did they know about it? 

...during the last six years, The US was directly involved in supporting the terrorists everywhere in Syria, including ISIS, including al-Nusra, including all the other like-minded factions in Syria, this is clear, and this is proven in Syria. While if you want to talk about the direct attacks, actually only a few months ago, there was a more dangerous attack than the recent one, just before Obama left, I think a few weeks before he left, it was in Deir Ezzor in the eastern part of Syria when they attacked a very strategic mountain, it was a Syrian base, a regular Syrian Army base, and that helped ISIS to take over that mountain, and if the Syrian Army wasn't resilient and strong enough to repel ISIS, the city of Deir Ezzor would have been now in the hands of ISIS, means a direct link between Deir Ezzor and Mosul in Iraq, which would have been a very strategic gain to ISIS. So, actually, no, the American government was directly involved. But this time, why did they attack directly? Because, as I said, the terrorists in that area were collapsing. So, the Unites States didn't have any other choice to support their proxies, the terrorists, but to directly attack the Syrian Army because they sent them all kinds of armaments and it didn't work....""

Syrian children were deliberately killed before filming in the representation of the chemist!

Swedish human rights organizations (SWEDRHR) have uncovered the so-called ""White Helmets"": They call themselves rescuers and volunteers. They did not save Syrian children, but on the contrary they killed them for more realistic media footage.

After checking the recorded footage showing the suffering of Syrian children as a result of a ""chemical attack"" Swedish experts concluded that ""rescuers"" inject the child with a dose of adrenaline in the heart area with a long needle , knowing that first aid to the victims of chemical attack is not done in this way.

In addition, the back of the syringe was not pressed into the recorded video, meaning that they did not inject the child with the drug.

According to the video, the Swedish doctors explained that the child was anesthetized by a general anesthetic and shows the child dying of increased dosage of the drug. 
Children showed no symptoms of chemical poisoning. it was a murder which was portrayed as a rescue operation, according to the American newspaper ""Veterans Today"".

In addition, the Western media did not properly translate the words against the background of the ""rescue operation"". 
One asked: ""How should I put the child before filming?"" No one uttered the word ""save the child"".

""EMERGENCY!
Act Now to Prevent a Trump Attack on Syria! Phone the White House and Congress Now!
Yesterday President Trump — who during the campaign expressed a desire for a new, more restrained approach to the war in Syria — publicly accepted the claim that the Syrian government is using chemical weapons against its own people, including children. He declared: ""Lines have been crossed."" He threatened to take some sort of action. The photos are horrific. The media has for several days gone into full hysteria mode, repeating unproven allegations, attributing blame, and relying on biased sources. Is this another Gulf of Tonkin?
This is more than a dangerous moment. It is a full-blown war crisis. It is no secret that President Trump is an impulsive and often ill-informed individual. His Administration in its first months has been buffeted by missteps, defeats, and embarrassments. He may think he ""needs a win."" We must make sure his Administration does not think an attack on Syria would be ""a win."" We have hours, at most a few days to do so.
We have been down this road before. Sophisticated observers have already noted this alleged attack has all the earmarks of a false flag operation. The Syrian government has absolutely no motive for mounting such an attack. (See: Gerry Condon; Patrick Henningsen)
http://worldbeyondwar.org/syria-gas-attack-almost-certainl…/
http://21stcenturywire.com/…/reviving-the-chemical-weapons…/
As a leader of Veterans for Peace, Gerry Condon, has wisely observed, the sources for the gas attack reports are the rebel forces themselves, their own media, and the ""White Helmets"" and other Western-funded NGOs who are notorious for creating ""regime change"" propaganda against the Assad government. Famed investigative reporter Seymour Hersh has documented that the last large Sarin attack blamed on the Syrian government was carried out by terrorist groups with the support of Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Hersh also documented that chemical weapons were transported from Libya to U.S.-backed rebel groups in Syria by the CIA and Hillary Clinton's State Department.
Yet the mainstream media do not mention any of this. They ask no tough questions. They entertain no doubts. They repeat previous lies that have already been debunked. They unashamedly interview sources which have long been cheerleaders for military intervention in Syria.
We can stop an attack. In 2013, an immense surge of phone calls to the White House and Congress stayed the hand of President Obama under similar pressure to ""do something."" We successfully prevented Obama from attacking Syria in 2013.
We can do it again. Pick up that phone!

* Call your Congress members House and Senate at 202- 224-3121

The full story of the events of the Euphrates dam
In the past two weeks, there have been horrifying reports about the dangers of the collapse of the Euphrates dam and the flooding of cities and villages with water. In fact, this inflated news covered the real disaster that has taken place in the dam.
Which is the end of the possibility of generating electricity forever, by a precision guided air force entered the command room and control the dam located on the fourth floor from its window to destroy all the equipment for the control of electricity generation dam dams and gates under the dam.
The missile was preceded by another air missile that hit the main electrical distribution yard, which controls the electricity generated from the dams.
The hydroelectric station consists of eight turbo turbines that operate with a water pump, eight generators with a capacity of 100 megawatts. The total capacity is eight hundred megawatts. A thousand megawatts of ampere, a large amount of electricity Syria desperately needed.
The rockets were not fired on the seventh floor, which is the location of the turbines, and with meticulous technical expertise, which was launched on the control room. This caused the closure of the entire dams and the return of the remaining water in front of the dam to submerge the three lower floors. And she is permanently out of service.
The dam building consists of twelve floors, the highest floor is the first floor and the bottom floor is the 12th floor.
The current amount of water in the dam lake does not pose a threat to its structure, especially with the weak flow of water from the current source and can pose a hazard after at least a month in case of discharge.
No one has entered the dam building yet, and no gates have been opened. As a result, a gate is opened about four kilometers from the main dam. The gate is called Khabour Gate. It is about 120 meters in the second of the water coming from the dam. There is no water flowing in the Euphrates River, which will affect the level of Lake Ba'ath dam following the Euphrates dam, which feeds the electricity generated from the areas of Al-Raqqa, which will make it stop soon for generation.
